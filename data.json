It's also a movie where an investigation is led and leaves frustratingly most of the mysteries unresolved. And the figure of the clown is so exaggeratingly over-the-top that it becomes not frightening, it shows off too quickly, too entirely, while suggestion is a much powerful tool in the harrowing realm. Moreover, clich\u00e9s of the horror genre sadly surface in 'It', which entertains without truly creating a sufficiently weird feel.", "I will start out by saying I had my concerns.

It has some jumps scares but most are legit. It has some issues, like some of the special effects. The most terrifying thing about It is the lasting effects it can have when you have over controlling parents All in all I was pleasantly surprised by It absolutely loved It.", "For a scary movie AND remake, this was very well-done. Effects were on point, soundtrack was great, cinematography did not disappoint, acting was just right (reminded me of the Goonies, those kids had good chemistry on screen), and the story stayed interesting.

Cannot wait for \"Chapter 2\"", "\"Packed with scares, haunting imagery and impressive visuals, \"It\" is a deliciously terrific horror film and it will certainly be in your nightmares for years to come\" Movie Review: It Date Viewed: September 9 2017 Directed By Andy Muschietti (Mama) Screenplay By Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, Based on the novel by Stephen King Starring: Jaeden Lieberher, Bill Skarsg\u013ard, Wyatt Oleff, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Jack Dylan Grazer, Chosen Jacobs, Nicholas Hamilton and Jackson Robert Scott.  Clowns don\\'t scare me at all. They just act silly and make annoying noises. I was never into scary clowns until now. \"It\" is a deliciously terrific horror film that never loses sight on the characters and the story. The film is of course based on Stephen King\\'s terrifying best-selling novel and it centers around seven children who square off against an evil clown named Pennywise. Even though this clown is full of scary tricks, the real monster in the film is actually the small town of Derry. With every Stephen King adaptation there\\'s always going to be bullies or neglectful parents but that didn\\'t bother me much because this story needed them to be cruel.  Before this film, there was also a 1990 miniseries with Tim Curry as Pennywise but it was downright laughable and the effects looked like crap. Even though it\\'s not quite up there with \"The Shawshank Redemption\", \"The Shining\" and \"The Green Mile\", \"It\" still ranks as one of the best Stephen King adaptations. The cast is mostly filled with unknown actors but the kids who compromise the film\\'s \"Losers Club\" are compelling and very good here. I was touched and moved by one of the kids in the film because he almost looks like me. The kid\\'s name is Benjamin \"Ben\" Hanscom (who\\'s played by Jeremy Ray Taylor), he\\'s the new kid in school and he likes reading and researching a lot but he doesn\\'t have any friends and he\\'s also very overweight. Like much of the outcast kids in Derry, Ben gets severely bullied but later in the film, he earns a spot in the Losers Club.  Unlike King\\'s novel and the 1990 miniseries, \"It\" doesn\\'t jump back and forth in time and switches the time frame from 1957-58 (in the book) and 1960 (in the miniseries) to 1988-89 where we follow Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) as he gives his little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) a paper-made sailboat to play with outside. Georgie takes the boat onto the street on a very rainy day but he is unable to stop it from sailing down the drain. Suddenly, he sees a scary-looking clown named Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsg\u013ard) holding a his sailboat. The clown introduces himself to Georgie as he offers him to take his sailboat back but instantly the clown severs his arm and he gets dragged into the sewer.  8 months after Georgie\\'s death, Bill is still haunted by his disappearance and he and his friends, Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) get picked on by bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) and his gang. Bill is also faced with the neglect from his grief-stricken parents (Geoffrey Pounsett and Pip Dewer) and he believes that his brother\\'s body may have washed up in a marshy wasteland raising the possibility that he may still be alive.  Meanwhile, the other outcast kids in Derry include Benjamin \"Ben\" Hanscom (who I mentioned earlier), a home-schooled, farmhand named Michael \"Mike\" Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs), who\\'s being racially bullied for the being the only black kid in town and the tough but also kind female member of the group, Beverly \"Bev\" Marsh (Sophia Lillis), she too is dealing with bullying at her school and her home life isn\\'t that great either, she lives with her violent and sexually abusive father (Stephen Bogaert). As Ben and Beverly join the club, Bill and his friends check out the marshy wasteland known as the Barrens where they discover the sneaker of a missing girl.  While he was in the library looking up some research about the town, Ben learned that Derry has been plagued by unforeseen tragedies and child disappearances for years. Soon, the kids have a terrifying encounter with Pennywise but he lets them off the hook for now. The kids also discover Henry Bowers and his violent bully gang beating up on Mike so what do they do? They fight off the bullies by throwing rocks at them and they chase them off.  The kids who prefer to themselves as the Losers club soon realize that they are dealing with the same terrifying entity that took Bill\\'s brother and all the other missing kids in Derry and they must find a way to overcome their fears and fight back against Pennywise. Bill Skarsg\u013ard is fiendishly scary and f$&amp;@ing awesome as Pennywise, this is a horror movie villain you cannot resist. He\\'s scary and terrifying for a number of reasons, he can feed on your fears, he can shapeshift into anybody, he can manipulate you and he has a lot of teeth. Sophia Lillis makes a splashing star-making performance as Beverly, the lone female member of the Losers club and Jaeden Lieberher who you may remember from \"Midnight Special\" and the Bill Murray comedy \"St. Vincent\" is also really good here as the stuttering Bill.  Even though \"It\" is a scary Stephen King tale, this film really succeeds in the coming-of-age department. The ragtag group of kids go on a morbid adventure and they sheer affection for one another. Director Andy Muschietti (who previously helmed the 2013 Jessica Chastain horror film \"Mama\") pulls off the tremendous feat of balancing horror and coming-of-age elements, Stephen King tropes and different tones and calibrating them into a movie that\\'s both frightening and surprisingly hilarious.  Since this film is only part one of Stephen King\\'s book, there\\'s obviously going to be a sequel and I think it will primarily focus on the kids as adults. The screenplay by Chase Palmer, Gary Dauberman (Annabelle: Creation) and Cary Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation and season one of \"True Detective\") is extremely faithful to King\\'s book and plus it has a sense of place. I did not see this film in a normal theater, I saw \"It\" in IMAX and it was a memorable experience.  Packed with scares, haunting imagery and impressive visuals, \"It\" will certainly be in your nightmares for years to come.", "Everything you could ask for in a horror film. Great performances, characters and a sinister villian done brilliantly by Bill skarsgard.", "Absolutely worth seeing.  I am a bit biased, I have always liked Stephen King\\'s books, and his movies. Yes, even the horrible ones. I do love the original tv series with Tim Curry, but Bill Skarsgard is just as good, but in a more horrific way.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS!     The first thing you have to know, this is only half the book. This is the kid portion of the story. They have already hired the writer and are starting the sequel which is supposed to be the adult story. They even ended the movie with a \"chapter one\" meaning they knew they were going to do it.  So let\\'s focus on the kids. They are all great, including the mouthy Finn from Stranger Things. The acting was great, the stories for each kid were interesting, and horrifying in their own ways (especially Henry and Beverly\\'s, yes even the bad kid Henry had an interesting and almost heart breaking childhood).  The effects were great, but they didn\\'t lean on them too much, a lot of darkness, a lot of charging attacks, but nothing so horribly CGI that it would jar. Although the greatest effect was Bill Skarsgard himself. The voices he could make, the looks he gave, especially the intensity, were the most horrifying thing in the movie.  The directing was great too. They cut the story down, made it lean by doing something I wasn\\'t sure about, only covering half the book. They also got rid of the group sex scene from the book, definitely made it less skeevy that way. All the decisions I saw made the movie better.  I rank it up there with Kubrick\\'s the Shining as one of my favorite King movies.  The good: Everything. The acting, directing and of course the source material.  The bad: I did feel like I was missing something, but that is because I have read the book and watched the mini-series and it felt strange to not have the adult half of the story. It was a good choice, and that bad is on me, but it was the one thing that made me hesitate.  GO SEE IT!", "The first one was way more fun", "well acted, well scripted, and well directed. powerful revisiting this new edition with a great cast of actors..", "When it comes to horror films, it is no surprise that I would be chicken with these that seeing it in theaters would be a mistake. Not only was it scary, but it was a true masterpiece. I loved a lot of things in this, from the acting to the special effects, and especially the writing. It basically screams out perfect, no pun intended. However, there are some moments where things can be a mix, but that doesn\\'t stop this from being 2017\\'s best horror film. In the theater I watched it in, one of the red balloons there actually floated up. Honestly, this movie was so good, it made me float out of my seat. This film gets a level 8/10. No doubt \"it\" was fun, this time pun intended.", "Too much bad language coming from little kids. Makes me sad for our future.", "An excellent King adaptation.

Very enjoyable film", "Great re-telling of the classic story, even if not really scary!   4/5 stars", "This was an amazing movie. Some say they didn't like the CGI, but I loved the way they made Pennywise move sometimes. He looked as if he was almost an anime character being attacked by human beings. I was astonished how his blood floated in the air and his mouth became bigger and bigger into beyond and infinity. A super good movie!", "Was expecting a lot more. All the buzz fooled me. They should have explained more of the back story about the town and IT (Pennywise). Where did he come from why was he tormenting the town. The movie was too much fluff. I think the movie industry is dying. The HBO shows have hundreds of hours to develop the story and characters. Two hours is not enough time to make me care about the characters in the movie. Dont waste your time with this movie.", "This is a masterfully done film. This is well acted, directed, and paced. This is an appropriate film right now in the discussion of fear in media. This is scary and creepy but not gruesome. It makes the statement that we, and not one else (no one will help you) need to stand up to the problem.", "Straight garbage.

I thought it was more funny than scary.", "It was a thrilling take on the Stephen King masterpiece. The movie added horror with adventure and was phenomenal.

Scares are there great cast and keeps you hooked. I will be interested to see how they handle chapter 2.", "BEST HORROR MOVIE OF ALL TIME! (well onley to me) but this adaptation of Stephen Kings book was a great movie in my opinion, it was scary and had a great cast.

Absolutely despicable! Don't waste ur hard earned money on some dumb ass kids imagining things.", "Terrifying and out-of-this-world! A must see for horror fans! 5/5", "been waiting for this sequel since the first day I seen the original which was 3years ago. Glad 30+yrs later they made the sequel no I can relax! The movie was great pretty close to the original in my opinion one of the best sequels I have ever seen I recommend it to all bladerunner fans its worth the money and wait", "Great adaptation of the novel. Pennywise was terrifying.", "The absolutely only reason I didn't fill every story is because they cut what I consider crucial aspects of that first half of the story; for instance the haunting by the fat boys father is cut as is the rest of the weird uncomfortable relationships with parents and adults which is a motivating and spectacularly creepy and mysterious aspect of the children's lives in the book. Also I hoped they would use the original ending. Though all in all, still one of the best horror films and Stephen King adaptations ever!", "Better late then never...It is a remake of the 1990 mini series and also a film adaptation to the Stephen King novel of the same name and is about a group of bullied kids known as the losers club who get stalked by this entity that takes stalks kids based off their fears, to the point that they decide to take manners into their own hands. Now I wasn't to sure going into this movie because I have always hated clowns with a burning passion, and because this films antagonist is a clown that made me reluctant to see it however I eventually made myself go and I have to be honest I found myself really loving this movie. The kid actors in this film are all excellent in portraying the parts especially Eddie played by Finn Wolfhard he was my favorite, he definitely stole the show and it was great to see him in something else after Stranger Things (2016), also Jaeden Lieberher who played Bill also did a great job in his role as well and after seeing him in films like Aloha (2015) and St. Vincent (2014) I liked seeing him out of his comfort zone. Both Wolfhard and Lieberher have bright futures ahead of them. And Bill Skarsgu\u013ard who plays Pennywise was great as well, and he's so much better than Tim Curry's version of the character from 1990. Now the best part about this film was the characters, there's is at least one (or even more) character in this film that reminds you of yourself. Another great aspect to this film was that it didn't shy away from violence. Also I love how the film doesn't rush into intensity it takes its time and gives us time to appreciate each of the characters. Now though It was an almost perfect film there are some mild flaws for instance the film is more intense then scary which could be a problem if you were looking forward to a horror film. Also the film is a little long and their were some scenes especially towards the middle that weren't necessarily important. And like i said before there is a lot of violence in it which though i just said i appreciated some people could find it upsetting because its aimed towards children (especially one scene in particular). In the end It was great, the film was intense, unpredictable and was just a perfect remake, though it may not be as scary as you want it to be it is still a lot of fun to watch. Despite mild flaws It is so far my favorite movie of the year, if you were disappointed with the previous The Dark Tower (2017) (another film that came out this year from Stephen King) which to my understanding everyone was or are tired of plain old cliche horror films than I highly recommend It for you. After you watch this movie you'll wish you were part of the Losers Club. If this director decides to go for part 2 I am going to be there the day of its release!", "Loved it great remake of the classic !", "This movie goes way beyond what I expected. It is a horror movie, but most importantly it is the story of a group of children with complex backgrounds that bound together to grow stronger.

Throughout my childhood I collected all of his made-for-TV book adaptations. By the virtue of a colorful cast and an epic run time, the 1990 miniseries was ranked considerably above the average horror. Back then, nobody except King would chance folding the human attention span with a horror movie that's over three hours. Hollywood character development would always be cautiously compacted. All of his book adaptations were innovative projects. In my opinion, none of them were let down. IT (1990) was no exception to Stephen King's miniseries criterion.  Now that twenty-seven years have passed, a no-name director from Argentina managed to acquire the rights for this blockbuster remake of the 1990 two-part miniseries adapted from King's 1986 novel. As foreseen in the trailer, judging the movie is unfair, for it's a portion of a grand scale project that doesn't sit well with a two-year gap. That's right... For those who didn't probe the Internet for IT'S destiny, the second chapter isn't scheduled to come out until 2019. A 700-day wait is in store, for a mystery that has already been divulged in two sources. Unfortunately, this film lacks the tactical mystery and blockbuster attributes necessary to warrant a GAME OF THRONES gap.  Taking everything into account, the revamp of Stephen King's IT is not at all terrible; nevertheless it's bound to its 80s roots, forcing modern novelty to be entirely substituted with multiple short-lived state-of-the-art terror tactics.", "Good acting, creepy ambiance, and great graphics make this remake ten times better than the original. A total must see for any horror buff!", "Certainly creepy scary and suspenseful, but perhaps less than the original miniseries did when I was younger. Perhaps the maturity of age does this. However, this is still a great film, more like a coming of age drama like Stand By Me or a Spielberg movie. A very prominent 80s vibe and tribute. And yes, the new Pennywise is still scary in a new way, but Tim Curry still haunts our childhood.", "Mandatory to see it. Very great movie. Love it.", "It was good but sooo much focus on the clown verses the story", "Greatest horror movie of the 2000\\'s. Upon seeing IT, I thought it was great, surpassed the original. However, I wanted more then I read more on the story, theories and the future of IT. Since then I\\'ve seen IT 4 times in the cinema and it won\\'t be the last time.

The effects are good, the directing and cinematography look good. Nothing feels cheap or fake and the tone of the movie makes this feel real. There's good acting all around. However, the movie feels generic and gets a little draggy in certain points. The movie is scary although only in that moment, never after.", "I thought was done fabulously. Much scarier then the t.v. version. Plot could've been built out better.", "Really good and spooky", "Very entertaining.

A bit silly", "When it comes to horror flicks, we have seen more haunting and outrageous things in recent years. There are a few jump scares and some scenes are wonderfully unpleasant, but not without a sick little twist of humor every now and then. Pennywise works most of the time, as well.

A very entertaining King adaptation, already a smash hit that will find its deserved continuation.", "It's more funny than scary...and somehow the supposed to be scary part of the movie, is almos an exact repetition from an early stage of the movie, so when the end comes, you already saw everything...that is an supid way of creating tension...the opposite of that, in fact...", "I thank the Mighty Turtle for this gift of gifts.

I do wish it was a lot scarier, but it's whatever. The characters I loved and the plot was fantastic. The deaths were super awesome and gruesome. The ending battle was amazing. But I do wish that it was scarier. But it is a horror movie where there is a lot of creepy moments. It was a lot better than the original, and it was all around a awesome movie. Great Job!", "I was a lil scared. STILL SMILING...", "I loved it. One thing that should be mentioned is that I barely consider this a horror film. It isn?t formatted like one. It doesn?t play like one. Yes, there is a killer demon clown but you could replace him with most anything else and have the same dynamic. This is a coming-of-age tale, like STAND BY ME. The kids are AMAZING. It works on most every level. The only criticism is some bad CGI in spots but overall the effects are really good.", "really well shot and frightening enough to keep you greatly entertained for two hours. Definitely an excellent entertainment.", "All around entertaining horror/suspense.

That?s how much I like this movie that?s why I give it a five stars and I can?t wait till the next chapter comes out in theatres.", "This was the best movie I've seen in a long time. I will honestly say I've seen it 5 times since it came out and each time I went, the theater always was pretty full...even a month after the movie came out. It has some scary parts, but isn't terrifying. The acting of the kids is phenomenal, the plot is amazing, and it's actually pretty funny. It's a must-see. It's one of those iconic movies where you'll be repeating one-liners all year round! Loved it!", "This is one of my favorite movies of all times. There are so many different elements in this film.

The downside, is you really set yourself up for disappointment if the hype is no good. The movie in my opinion was terrible! Skarsgard did a great job, but the movie was quite boring for about an 1 hr.....definitely shouldn't be rated R considering it was made for 10 yr olds. Stranger Things is better", "The film accomplishes almost everything it set out to. The movie never really felt like a true horror film, but more like a coming of age film with horror elements in it. There were times that the movie was more funny that it was scary. Truly enjoyable to watch, can't wait for part two to come out.", "I watched the remake and then the mini series afterwards and in some ways the miniseries felt like a spoof of the remake.

Funny. A little scary. Worth seeing once for sure", "This film captures the vision of the original 1990 tv-series while still deviating from the book quite a bit. Although this movie plays into a lot of the original aspects of the \"loser\\'s club\" from the book, it does stray a bit from character development. For those wanting a horror movie that plays true to the times, this definitely reels in the audience. For hardcore fans of both the book and the mini-series, although this may not be your cup of tea, this film definitely has quite a few nods to book references that fans are sure to pick up on.  I would have to point out that my biggest issue involving this version of the book, is how frequently you see Pennywise. In most horror films, the \"boogeyman\" of the film is seen a few times, and more in-depth during the climax of the film. This film you are bound to see Pennywise at least 20 times, and the fact that you see the exact form of Pennywise in the first 10 minutes of the film, set it up to create a casual feeling around the main sinister character. Although the story created a triumphant, but not entirely resolved ending, I cannot possibly see how the terror of Pennywise could be instilled in the second half of the movie.", "I don't know how I managed to go over five weeks without seeing a movie that proved itself to a cultural phenomenon, but alas, it happened. It wasn't that I didn't want to see it since I truly did, but hey, I finally saw it, and I can't say that I see what everyone fell in love with. What starts off promising loses a substantial amount of steam as it goes on, the script struggling to give equal time for each of its many characters and its scenes lacking enough connective tissue at times. It has its moments but not enough to fill 135 minutes, a runtime that overstays its welcome by at least 20 minutes. I didn't really float; it was more like hovering. I would give a plot synopsis here, but a.) it's It, and b.) everyone has already seen this movie. The strengths on display here are largely technical, courtesy of director Andy Muschietti (Mama) and cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung, the latter of whom regularly works with Park Chan-wook. It has a pretty great look to it at times, in turns dreary, sunny, and saturated in accordance with locales and themes. The movie is often blood-red eye candy, its more suspenseful scenes shot with a cemented energy that allows the audience to at once follow what's unfolding and gain a spacial understanding of the settings, namely in act three. The performances are also notably strong, especially for child actors. Their delivery of Chase Palmer, Cary Fukanaga, and Gary Dauberman's dialogue, which is easily the strongest aspect of their script. The script, however, is the main issue, trying but largely failing to juggle and flesh out its peripheral characters and their respective domestic lives. The rapport of the main six in question illustrates their relationships well and does a commendable job at recreating the obnoxiousness of 13-year-olds and their needs to prove their virility over their peers, but the don't function that well in their own rights. The characters' fears that comes from past experiences and aspects of their upbringings are approaching with varying amounts of depth, ranging from fascinating to maddeningly simplistic. In the first half, the film's messiest manifest themselves by way of scenes that work alone but lack enough connective tissue to always form a cohesive whole, and towards the ending, the script issues really only shown themselves as one moment that really brings a side character's personality to an extreme that isn't really earned. It is something that I'm glad that I saw fit multiple reasons, but none of them were adequate in having me declare a positive opinion of it. The exploration of teenage angst by way of hormonal horror allows for complex themes, but a movie doesn't have the time to apply that probing look to a half-dozen tweens in 2.25 hours. Its entertainment value wavers from great to underwhelming, and it's funny at times but never is scary. It's creepy and suitably macabre when warranted, but I often found myself wishing that it was as well rounded and centered as the thematically comparable A Nightmare on Elm Street. They even reference the franchise in It by way of advertising on the outside of a movie theater, but that's the fifth movie, not the first. Maybe they knew what would make them look better by comparison and add to the '80s nostalgia. That's a double whammy right there. 5.6/10, meh, C, average, etc.", "Even though there was a ton of swearing and blood/gore this seemed juvenile.", "Original is BETTER BY FAR. How can this be with all this GARBAGE CGI and millions more to make a movie? They concentrate on \"cheap\" thrills, not character development and story.  GARBAGE compared to the original. A SHAM and a FAKE version,", "I never expected that this movie I like so much, but in the end I'm surprised by the results. I was scared at first that this movie was just a full of screamers, but thank God it was not like that. Well what I liked too were the characters because each one has a time on the screen to develop them well and that makes them memorable and talking about characters that I thought Pennywise his design I did not like at first but then with time I got in a good mood I did not go to see the film in the cinema for the design but as I would be the performance of Bill Istvan G\u00fcnther Skarsg\u013ard as Pennywise, and in the end I like I do not think that it surpasses Tim Curry but if it is at its reach because I love its scenes and the strange and uncomfortable way that gave us and that was the best part of the movie. It is a very good movie with a lot of blood and gore but at the same time it has a nice message of friendship and family and I am sure you will entertain if you are a fan of the genre of terror.", "Best horror movie that I have seen in a long time.

While I hated it because it literally gave me nightmares, it was a well made film and if I didn?t hate clowns I would probably have enjoyed it.", "Not exactly scary (there are only few scenes that are scary like the lady from the painting), but still enjoyable. I think the best part of the movie are the scenes where the Loser's club are together and when they try to fight there fears. It gave me a Stand By Me vibe, and as a millennial I actually feel relatable to the characters. I hope Chapter 2 will be adding more layers to Pennywise and make him more scary.

I'm terrified of clowns, but love a good horror movie and this one completely terrified me. Every time it was foreshadowed that Pennywise would join the screen I became anxious. The opening scene with Georgie lived up to the book minus them leaving out one traumatizing line by Pennywise that Disturbed me more than the removal of the arm. Why didn't they keep that in after they committed to so much more? grrrr.. Back to Pennywise and his shape shifting to target each child's fear, especially Bev's was brilliant. Though the fears are different than the story for some, it was well done. The kids were excellent at portraying their characters and you get attached. The adults were awful but meant to be portrayed that way so kudos..I hated you all.    Pennywise was the star. Though Curry did a fantastic job, he was just outshined. Skarsgard was traumatizing.. down to his voice, mannerisms, facial gestures.. Everything. This movie did not hold back as the book is quite graphic. I applaud everyone involved in this movie and cannot wait for Part 2 (the book has them come back to address Pennywise again but as adults). I cannot wait!!! However this one will keep me satisfied until then. If you love good traumatizing horror...go see this. Fantastically, edge-of-your-seat, terrifying!!!", "Bill Skarsg\u00e4rd brings some creepy fitting role as Pennywise, I loved this movie, everything is good, it's creepy and Is a perfect adaptation to Stephen King's Creepy, Disturbing, and awesome novel   There is one problem that I had with this movie, when poor Georgie dies, Bill does not really show any emotion whatsoever, we get one nice and beautiful scene with Bill mourning Georgie, but really it seems like Bill does not give a crap!", "exactly what you thought you would see but oh so good.", "It seemed like they were trying to hard to stretch out the storyline just so they could make a sequel.

I am turning 18 this year and this is my first horror movie I\\'ve ever seen. AND I LOVED IT!!!  The movie \"IT\" really give you the chills and some scares. Definitely worth the R rating. However, if you are afraid of clowns, get scared really easily, or get nauseous around blood, I would not recommend this movie. It was also really funny. Lots if sexual jokes though. But overall great humor and the kids were AMAZING actors.

It doesn't float, it soars.", "I had waited a long time for this, but seriously, that was a waste of time. Kinds, are okay, but that adaption should not be seen when you know the TV version or read the book.  The CLown was designed scary, but when looking at it, i cannot imagine one kid who would seriously be talking to it, and Tim Curry was a way more funnier clown than this one is. I know, it should be a scary film, but it was not that, and the only fun were Ritchie's comments. Tim Curry's version had a funny sinde that was entertaining at least, and was way more memorable. Then there is Mike. Originally, he was the substence that held the group together, reuniting them after 27 years. Turned into nothing more than a sidekick. His most imortant characteristics, him being a history geek is oddly enough added to Ben. Well, I was lucky that it was a cheap offer at the cinema, Not worth it, honestly. I have no idea what the people here seee in it. Maybe IT made them float? ^_^ Saying that, i have to say The Dark Tower was better than this.", "The new film by Stephen King has found its situation: It is a soft film. The chances are that they are a little out of step with my assessment, but knowing the writer and given the situation made by the director, I have to recognize some things that have caught my attention, like the story, which could have been a little more violent , or the villain, who could have been more picturesque, but still reminds me more of a Torrance Jack that is altered by not having drunk much Bourbon. Finally, proposing this alternative, for those who are very scared, this movie may make them lose their fear, because it is totally predictable.", "Was really good, definitely worth seeing.", "Full of heart and full of fun. Well-casted. Falls short on scares and once you've reached the half-hour mark, you start to forget you were watching a horror movie. Would consider this a black comedy.", "Outstanding movie.

This a must-see Stephen King masterpiece.", "Terrifying at ITs core, yet provides a great balance of kids being kids during the summer, and the humor that comes along with those actions.

Half a star for some of the effects, but otherwise I was bored and couldn't wait for the f-rated slop to end. Skip it---quickly!", "With jump scares' arriving precisely when you know they will, IT plays like a jack-in-the-box. Yet cinematography by Chung-hoon Chung and committed performances from the child leads (and Skarsg\u013ard as the titular creature) help raise this balloon above Its deflated peers. Though light on fright, IT has a big heart, and ITs characterization both trumps King's novel and reminds us how he won the crown in the first place. Buy it.", "Its well acted, has a great story and is told nicely. And it gets creepy at times especially as the house scene in the middle which is by far the creepiest scene in the movie. However, its not so scary thus not a perfect movie", "Maybe its just my fear of clowns, but It is really very scary. Not only that but it delivers as a coming of age film just like the source material. Excuse me now as I try (and fail) to sleep.", "Very scary movie. WOW Casey went with me.", "Im sorry, I dont see the hype. There are scattered creepy moments, but ultimately Skarsgard is not particularly scary as Pennywise and none of the heroes are all that interesting either. By the end its all rather silly... I'll say this though, it beats the snot out of AHS' current clown saga.", "I'd give it no stars but that's not an option This movie wasn't worth the money or time I really went into it with high hopes especially considering the rating on here.

And I have to say I was not let down it was way better than I was expecting and I was expecting it to be my favorite movie. All the actors were all great. bill scarasgard (idk if I spelled his name wright) who played penny wise the dancing clown was superb he was 50 times better than Tim curry (who was also great) and all the kids were amazing especially Finn Wolfhard who played ritchy. He was that kid in every group of friends who is always cracking jokes and he made this feel like a Stephan Spielberg movie at times. Although the movie is horror it was hilarious but only when it had to be. Think about it has there ever been a situation where kids got together and everyone was serious. No it's never happened and that's what I love about this movie, it was scary, funny, and even had a good message about friendship if you get the chance go see this movie you won't be disappointed. This is by far my favorite movie.  My rating 99.5/100 and good for teens 15+", "A disappointment.

There are moments that feel like it's meant to be more of a cheesy fun movie. Not that I'm against those type of horror films, I love them. But they do feel a tad displaced. Also, it has some CG affects that are a bit lackluster.  But those are minor pet peeves because, when it comes down to it. The film's very well made, and well acted. Bill Skarsgard and the child actors, all did an amazing job, with some genuine scares to boot.   I also love the approach compared to the book and mini series, where while they alternated between the main characters as kids and adults. This film just focused on them as kids, while part 2 will be them as adults, thus making the story more linear and less of a headache.   Hope chapter 2's as good, the cast will have big, or rather little in this case, shoes to fill.", "I'm terrified of clowns and this movie was the dumbest thing since Paranormal Activity.", "It didn't even come close to the hype, and seemed to be a somewhat serious parody of itself. I didn't think much of the first adaptation either so I guess it's mostly just me.", "This was a great movie, I can't wait for the second one. I didn't find it scary so much as creepy.", "When it comes to Stephen King books taking life on celluloid, few have been above average. Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, MIsery, Stand By Me, and The Shining would probably round out the list of adaptations that hit the mark. That is not to say that the rest were abominations, just not quite what one would hope for. Enter \"It.\" The movie draws parallels to the great 1986 hit, Stand By Me in that coming of age feel. The character development of everyone but Pennywise is absolutely phenomenal. I must say that even in the book Pennywise is very mysterious purposefully. What the screenplay writers and director did was not to rush an 1100 page novel into a 2 hour movie and leave half the story on the cutting room floor. *Small spoiler* This is only part 1. Overall, the acting from these young stars is unmatched. At no time do you feel as though the dialogue is forced or unmatched to the character. Bill Skarsgard\\'s Pennywise makes the character written for Tim Curry look like an innocent princess. While I am not a huge fan of CGI, its use in this film does add depth to the nightmarish prince of demon clowns. At no point during the 2 hours and fifteen minutes of this gem, will you ever think \"this could have been shorter.\" While this may not technically be considered a remake, if you enjoyed the original miniseries even the slightest, you will be delighted by this 2017 reboot.", "IT wasn't bad at all!!! First of all, I thought it wouldn't be accurate to the novel. I was surprisingly wrong. It was original enough and kept enough elements of the novel to make it an mazing movie. IT may not be as scary as I thought but still it is fun and enjoyable to watch. The only complain I have is about Pennywise being too much clown. Bill Skarsgard was amazing though!!!", "Can't say it trumps the old IT, nostalgia wins. But I really like the character build up, pace of the movie. The movie is well made and thought off.

If you\\'ve seen the old IT, you pretty much seen this one, although they change the scenes to fit the R rating, which in my opinion forces the horror. Horror should make you feel uneasy. This movie will make people who scare easily uneasy obviously and that is what it accomplishes.   The actors do not really give Oscar worthy performances, but they\\'re kids. What can you expect?  Last but not least, Pennywise. Bill Skaarsgard did a pretty decent job, but I prefer Tim Curry\\'s Pennywise. The subtle, friendly at first vibe you get from Tim Curry\\'s version is unsettling, along with his facial expression ultimately leading to something demonic. All this without CGI.

In my opinion, dedicating about two hours to just these two themes was not enough to fully capture my attention. Additionally, there are some \"wtf\" moments where things just did not make sense, but maybe that is due to the content they had to work with (aka Stephen King\\'s novel), although I\\'m glad they made the executive decision to cut out the orgy scene.

I watched the mini series when it came out on tv when I was a teenager. Tim Curry obviously was a brilliant Pennywise in his own right. Obviously with the censors hacking at it, it ruined the series. I still liked it. But now Bill Skarsgard has taken Pennywise to the next level with scares and frights. He plays the role with a passion and you can see it in his ability to make an innocent childlike sounding clown be so terrifying at the same time. He did a brilluant job and can't wait to see him in chapter 2. I read IT as a teen and it was the only book to ever scare me enough to not want to read it after dark.??

Worth a look but not up there with elite horror films.", "The gist here is that the figure of evil is not quite so interested simply in your demise, per se, which would be one thing, but rather in how well it can scare the living daylights out of you before, er, your demise. In that regard the film succeeds quite well. Especially interesting is how the characters all have enough troubles to want to quit Maine entirely even before they meet the please-don't-come-any-closer clown, and no one would judge them. But they have a decision to make ultimately, and on that decision the film turns: to work together as a team or no, problems or no, distractions or no, and the work conveys the enormity of that choice in the wonderful language of adolescence. Good times at the movies.", "Not as scary as I thought it would be. The Characters are interesting and Pennywise the Clown was more funny than threatning. The some of the Human adults we're more horrible than Pennywise.", "gave it a stranger things vibe", "This movie it's one of the best of 2017, I'm a big fan of the horror genre and I don't really have fear of clowns but this film is creepy enough to keep you away from a circus. Not just there, but from your basement, old houses, rivers and many more. This movie doesn't focus on putting cheap jump-scares out there but make it's scenarios bite their nail whenever pennywise comes around. This movie is just not a horror movie but a heart touching one. It's a heart touching one, because once you meet the losers club you don't want the movie to end. They are a group that helps the movie improve and soon you also start to care about every single one of them because all of them have a weak point where the clown feeds on. As a lover of horror I would recommend you to watch the movie, it's worth seeing and it might turn into one of your favorites. I'm waiting for the sequel to come out. To hopefully see the losers club reunite!", "IT is a wonderful adaptation of one of Steven Kings most beloved works. All the child actors did a a great job, Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was creepy while simultaneously energetic, and the camera work was well done. The story takes place in the 80's fallowing children living in a town where many strange disappearances have occurred. The kids in question have all seen a creepy clown and when they look into it they discover something more sinister is going on in the town. While this has been the best film I've seen all year there are a few nit picky things that stopped me from saying this was any more the a 4/5. The special effects where fantastic in certain places. When pennysise transforms into himself from something else or anything with his mouth is just gold but other shots seem unnecessary and out of place. One person is meant to be a leaper but in the movie it seemed like there was too CG rather then makeup to bring it to life. Other shots where you can just barely tell its CG pull you out of the movie. There was some other parts that bugged me but that would mean me going into spoilers. Overall this was a great film that will likely top most best movie lists this year. SPOILERS: When did Stanley get split up from the group in the tunnels? He starts going off on everyone about how they left him but I don't remember a shot of him or anyone else getting split up and I don't think I missed something because I've talked with other people who also shared this thought. Whats with Bill not fallowing his own advice? He went on about not splitting up then after seeing his dead brother ditches his friends. He knows what Pennywise can do and even shows hes not gullible to his tricks so why perpetually fall for this one? Why does the kiss sure Beverly? Why are all those kids floating? they mention that Pennywise doesn't kill Beverly because shes not afraid so is that why he made her float? Are all the kids who float not afraid of Pennywise or are they just there for a smack later? Why does Pennywise manipulate Henry? At first I thought it was because Pennywise was recovering from the pipe in his neck and might be weak but they just throw that idea out the window when they show he clearly isn't weak at all. Lastly I'm sad that this is just part one of a larger story. It makes sense to end it here from what i've heard and makes more sense then other stories that do this like harry potter or the hunger games. The book was written like this so makes sense do to it like this. But its just frustrating, I wish the ending didn't make is so clear that the kids expected him to be coming back. Would have liked its more if it felt like we could end it here and then get surprised when he comes back rather then a 27 year long intermission.", "Creepy. I'm not afraid of clowns but this movie was plain creepy and disturbing.   I wasn't a big fan of the ending but I was OK with it and it didn't take away much in terms of overall enjoyment.  I liked it so much it led me down the wormhole of looking up info about the original book, original series, the easter eggs hidden in the movie, etc.  I'm looking forward to seeing part 2 when it comes out.  I recommend this movie.", "Brilliant evocation of one of King's most visceral and terrifying works.", "pretty good. kids only. lol", "All great in this movie... I hope for chapter 2 it's the same director", "I really enjoyed this movie. I can't tell how close it is to the book, as I only have read the first 700 pages.. Why did I not give it a higer rating? I think the number of children should have been reduced to five (from seven). Beth, Ben (with parts of Eddie), Bill (with parts of Richie), Mike and Stan.", "A fantastic revival of Stephen King's masterpiece book. A heart-gripping thriller that will take you to a chilling ride into the abyss of your soul.Andy Muschietti's direction and the movie screenplay's fluidity, are evenly matched by the child actors' great performances. IT's frightful visceral story, will take you back to the small town of Derry at the late 80's, and permeate you with questions about morality, personality issues and tabboos, leaving you indagating about society, human nature and who the true villains are in the end..  Cherry-topping it all.. Bill Skarsgard's unsettling and unique deliverance of Pennywise is highly creepy and remarkable. Worth of watching in any way possible.", "The movie really did not live up to the hype. After a great opening scene, the rest of the movie really was not captivating or scary. My girfriend has read this novel by Stephen King over 10 times and was sadly disappointed. Very little of what is in the movie comes from the book. Overall, I would give it 4 out of 10. Waste of money and of an evening.", "more of a thriller than a horror movie. i think its definitely the best adaptation of the novel. it took out some unwanted bits and made changes that worked well together. what i liked most about this film was the characters, cgi, symbolism, and soundtrack. something i didnt like was how the relationship between ben and beverly was put on the shelf and never discussed. there were also some poor acting bits, but other than that im giving it 5 stars.", "Very few flaws and utterly creepy, IT succeeds on most fronts. The kids performances were absolutely believable and funny when need be. Bill Skarsgard's performance (while less clown than Currie's) was encapsulating and terrifying.

IT is extremely entertaining, and funny. I guess I loved the movie just as much as I loved the miniseries 27 years ago when Pennywise last woke up. It is clearly a movie based on Stephen King\u00b4s novel, but most of the dark/disturbing scenes were omitted or really toned down, but I guess that\u00b4s a good thing. A movie doesn't have to be an exact adaptation of its original source, we can always go back and read the book, which I highly recommend doing!!! :D", "felt like a shitty stranger things parody", "All remakes should be as awesome as this. 100 times better than the original. And stays more true to the book. Looking back at the original now, it was pathetic compared to this true version. Can't wait for chapter 2!!!", "not as scary as i thought it would be.", "This is actually a piece of garbage film with a huge marketing budget!. History is totally dull, horros scenes are predictable, storyline has no consistency, special effects are 20 years old and c script is pretty predecible. It is a bad remake with a possible sequel, god saves us from 21th century Hollywood garbage. This is by far the worst movie of 2017", "Terrifyingly awesome!", "It was not that scary, but still a good movie. New age Goonies vibe.", "Seemed quite forced and over the top. Didnt like casting. Didnt warm to characters some of whom also seemed ott. Animation too much... Simple is better. Some of blood and gore was unnecessary and went too far. Everything was trying too hard - the sewer was bigger and dirtier than original, the basic down to earth elements were all missing, the haunted house was a cliched haunted house. The scene with the blood in the bathroom where the girl is pulled into sink was very terrifying! Also, The Smoking Man from X-Files wasnt in it like the original- so how could it be good?", "Not in the least bit scary, but it is a good movie. What bums me out the most with this movie is the reliance on CGI, it is not scary, it completely removed me from the moment. It felt like watching an expensive episode of goosebumps with blood and swearing. Not to mention pennywise (bill skarsgard) isn\\'t given enough development to be anything more than personality-less cartoon clown. Ugh, it\\'s like every single \"scary\" scene they made it so limp and dull", "The best new horror movie I have seen in years. Great atmosphere and tension. Beautifully shot.", "Fantastic performance by Skarsgard!! Fantastic Movie!!", "If you\\'re going to see IT expecting a terrorizing horror film, you may leave slightly disappointed. Everything else, however, is a wholeheartedly good time. In a nutshell, IT is about a group of kids banding together to defeat the monstrosity known as Pennywise. Pennywise\\'s greatest strength comes from being able to utilize each person\\'s greatest fear against them, thus often manifesting itself into the form of a clown.   The first third or so of the movie doesn\\'t take many creative or narrative risks, and is marred by the occasional hit-or-miss piece of dialogue delivery, sprinkled in with healthy servings of jump scares. Each of the characters receives their own unique introduction, and thankfully, serve as a solid starting point to their eventual growth. And I say thankfully, because if it were instead a bore-fest, then you\\'d have over 7 intros eating up copious amounts of time.   Once this passes, the movie snaps into place and genuinely starts to surprise me. While each of the kids are fairly interesting on their own, it\\'s their interactions amongst the entirety of the group that works to perfection. Generally speaking, kids have a tendency to act irrationally, communicate using vulgar language, and most importantly-learn from mistakes. All of these aspects come to fruition in a way that feels both authentic, and hilarious. The importance of this can\\'t be overstated, since IT is largely a film about the kids themselves, and their ability (or lack thereof) to face their fears. Their varying levels of immaturity, snappy comments, and dorkish quips had me reassessing the bar at which child actors should be held to. If you took any joy at all from watching Netflix\\'s Stranger Things, then you\\'ll feel right at home.   Though the rag-tag group of kids carry the weight of the film in glorious fashion, it doesn\\'t come without its fair share of flaws. It feels like there\\'s a fair amount of indecision going on behind the camera. Characters will share an exceptional moment, only to be followed up by horror movie tropes and erratic pacing. It\\'ll start to feel a bit long in the tooth by the film\\'s conclusion, but at this point, we-the audience-have invested so much into each character that we\\'re entranced to see it through.   Pennywise, the movie\\'s main antagonist, is most frightening in the early stages of the film-mostly due to the few moments in which it makes an appearance. H.P. Lovecraft once said that, \"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\" This holds perfectly true as we envision Pennywise as something much scarier when the mind has to fill in the blanks. Once it shows its true form, it becomes significantly less scary-but this could be considered deliberate, since the children start to share similar views as the movie goes on.   Despite some of the directorial inconsistencies, IT is a (mostly) refreshing take on the horror genre. While it ventures dangerously close to reinventing what the genre could look like going forward, it does more than enough to set a solid foundation. Horror started off the year with Get Out, and now we have IT. Should this pace keep up, then count me in for the long haul.", "Muschietti's IT is by far one of the truest &amp; best remakes I have ever seen &amp; it's also a horror film so that on its own tells a lot. The performances by the young actors are phenomenal &amp; Skarsg\u013ard is hauntingly sinister as Pennywise. The cinematography is stunning &amp; the story manages to remain fresh while still closely sticking to the pace of the original &amp; its themes. I personally appreciated the cleverly placed nodes to the original in various occasions. I liked some of the notable changes &amp; others I didn't, mainly because they'll eventually contradict with the 2nd Chapter if they choose to follow it as closely as they followed this one.", "Surprisingly good. Although the movie was long, it was good that they skipped over something which could have made the movie even more time consuming than the miniseries. They skipped stupid parts which the miniseries had as well (does the spider come to mind?). Took off stars for a couple of things... 1. I wish movies would add to the rating cruelty to animals (yes I know this isn't real). I would not have seen this had I known that they were going to show a few things that they did. 2. I felt that they didn't really show what Phil and Ben were really scared of. Phil was just scared of a painting?

It started a lot like the original film but turned into a much scarier movie.", "Great movie my favourite horror movie", "Don't compare this to the 1990 original or approach it as a remake but rather as a whole new movie. While congratulation are in order for the direction, cinematics and the cast I feel some of the suttle changes in the plot meant this version of the classic Stephen King novel does not quite live up to expections. All in all worth a try though.", "Looks like another Hollywood remake that will just be an ok horror movie. This is one of the scariest novels of all time and it\\'s quite sad how shitty the movie will be. The new pennywise also looks overly \"scary\" instead of it being creepy/uncomfortable.

Better than any recent Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell movies.", "So much fun! Definitely worth a watch. Felt as if you were walking through a haunted house-- the fun kind of scary. Also, the child actors really hung in there and did a great job. I was impressed all the way around.", "Really well done.

I will admit that this movie will fall short with some audiences, but is more likely to come across as one of the most entertaining horror films in a long time. Even without the horror aspect, the movie would still be decent. Good acting, intriguing characters, and much more of what you could want from a Stephen King adaptation. Audience opinions on this film could really vary depending on how the suspense, scares, and CGI dependant scenes sit with the particular audience.

None the less, can't wait for chapter two.", "Wasn?t too scary, but good.", "It was kind of stupid. The first scene was fantastic! But after, it wasn't all that scary.

The best horror film that I have seen in years.", "Bill Skasgard is amazing in it, and so are the kids", "\\'Stephen King\\'s It\\' is a ghoulishly unshackled update of the Maine author\\'s coulorophobia book and it is superlative in every facet to the 1990 television miniseries which is now pitifully antiquated and meretricious in hindsight other than Tim Curry\\'s baritone performance. By antedating the film from 1950\\'s milieu to the 80\\'s, the peripheral set decoration is chockfull of \\'Gremlins\\' posters and a facetiously arcane reference to the \"Molly Ringwald\" of the group. It\\'s catnip for the yuppie generation who were reared on Street Fighter arcade games and New Kids on the Block cassettes. Although scribes Chase Palmer, (defunct director) Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman are steeped in coming-of-age King staples (the mulleted bullies, the cluelessly clodhopper parents who vicariously haunt their children via Munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy, molestation, etc.), it is more of a neoclassical and old-fashioned nod than an assortment of hoary clich\u00e9s. Usually the integration of special effects into Pennywise\\'s (Bill Skarsg\u013ard) rakish appearances would be an eyesore but instead they annex a Stygian quality to his gangly movements such as when he is a contortionist out of the Well House fridge or when his jaw unhinges into serrated fangs. Luckily, the unanimously excellent Losers\\' Club isn\\'t entirely expository about the Easter explosion and the delitescent backstory to the Pennywise\\'s 27-year gap in his cannibalistic frenzy. However, the summer-vacationers cleaning up a sink bloodbath is lackluster to the magical-realism. As a presentational exhibition, each of Skarsg\u013ard\\'s spooky happenings is a stinger than can be jaunty (a three-door choice of either Very Scary or Not Scary At All), a cheeky background nuance (a stentorian librarian lingering behind the focal point) or frightfully subliminal like a children\\'s show which serenades Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) to slice his father\\'s throat with a box-cutter.", "go blow your dad you mullet wearing asshole", "A wonderful Halloween time movie that focuses on the surreal rather than the jump scares.", "this is easily the best movie of the year", "The film was thrilling, some of the scenes made me jump.

No Did this movie meet my low expectations? No  Overall it is ok. Would be good standalone movie or if you haven't seen the 90's movie or read the book. Another thing is the movie is trying too hard to be scary.", "Alright-giving this a four star rating as a stand alone film and have to say it's hard pulling a part the undoubted bias opinion I had walking into the film and the ingrained influence from Tim Curry's performance in the original.  As a film on its own-It was great. The acting was spot on and as an audience member, I'd only complain about the lack of nostaglic feels simply because Stranger Things existed prior to this films release and safe to say, no film can hold a candle to their work. The writing was heartfelt and real. It was a good watch and I think will be an iconic piece of film for the next generation. IT did not try to mimic prior performances of the characters-but made something original.", "It was a lot scarier in the 90's. Stop with the remakes.", "Better than the original. I liked everything about the movie.", "A respectable update", "It was better than Thing, scarier than They, funnier than Them, and... ok enough of that :-) This re-vamp of Stephen King's novel and miniseries from the 90s was quite good. Pennywise (no disrespect to Tim Curry) was much creepier this time around. My wife, kids, and I loved this movie and are desperate to watch it again.", "May not have been like the original but this one was really good. They did a good job with Pennywise. Very creepy!", "Exposes too much in the visuals and leaves little to nothing to the imagination. The film suffers from major plot-holes and the need to please a general audience. Yet another horror movie ruined by Hollywood standards.", "don't waste your time. it's stupid and not scary", "IT is a Stephen king adaptation marvel from beginning to end", "I don't usually like scary movies but I liked this one.", "Fantastic scary and a wonderful remake.", "Pennywise has never been this grotesque and terrifying, which definitely helps make this a really effective adaptation that has a lot of great scares, focusing exclusively on the teenage versions of its characters as they fight an entity that embodies their innermost fears.", "This is more like a young adult adventure movie to me rather than the horror movie that I expected. I know that it's probably a sin to compare a book to the movie based on it, but here I am contemplating whether they followed the book down to a T or not (or if it matters lol). I still enjoyed it and the jump scares were still good. Pennywise was just... not as scary as he was in my head before I watched the movie. So yeah, that's all I have to say.", "Pennywise the dancing clown, The Bowers Gang, &amp; The Losers Club were fantastic. It was extremely entertaining, intense, scary, funny, thrilling, emotional, &amp; disturbing. IT is one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever !!!!!!! 9.5/10", "Muy buena opcion para este Halloween, nunca vi las previas versiones pero imagino que los efectos son mejores ahora. Quedan muchas cosas sin aclarar pero seguro habran mas secuelas que lo aclararan", "Fantastic horror flick", "Creepy, frantic, and enough their for the book lovers. Loser club was great. The twisted adult characters added a fantastic edge to the screen for me and put that little bit of uneasiness and tension into proceedings. Derry looked and felt fantastic, with lovely little details of the timeline. The demon/Pennywise was really good. It held together very well until the final chapter for me where the frantic nature became a little too much and how it delivered on screen felt a little unsatisfactory to me. Nightmare on Elm Street comparisons have always been constant with IT for me, but it was ever so prominent in this limited background tale taken to screen to appease horror enthusiasts. However in the true essence of the book the film did play on childhood fears and confusion very well for at least three quarters of this enjoyable movie. Looking forward to seeing how well the part two with adults can be done. For me this is far more difficult a task.", "Those kids are amazing. Very powerfull movie, with deep psycological significance, not a typical horror movie at all.", "This movie has everything you want!!! I love it so much!! You should totally watch it. It has comedy, romance, action, and horror. I FRICKEN LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!", "really want to see IT", "WOW.... perfect remake I will say this I can't wait for Chapter 2", "Great visuals and great story!", "First time when I saw a horror movie in a theater. That was a great experience. While the book is better, I consider this adaptation one of the best, along with The Mist, and 1408. Must see for a horror, and Stephen King fans.", "Looks like a good adaptation, but it\\'s more a thriller than a horror film. The performances were great and all, but I never actually felt creeped out or disturbed or moved. That\\'s what I look for in a good horror movie. \"It\" is a series of unfortun-It events.", "Excellent. The chemistry and performances between the kids was spot on. Something definitely missing from the original version. Nicely shot and set a great tone. Pennywise was terrifying and unpredictable. This version was much closer to the book as well. I can't wait for the followup!!", "It brings a constant terror throughout the whole film. There is less of a focus on jump scares and more of a focus on telling the story that Stephen King created. This creates a really strong foundation for the horror of Pennywise stalking through a dim lit kitchen and creapily befriending a young boy. Really feels like a true Stephen King experience where terror is in every scene or at least just around the corner.", "It was more funny than scary, booboo", "Went in with high anticipation, but it simply bored me till the final act.", "I don't know if we really needed a remake but this is definitely scary and with a classic Stephen King vibe. Who doesn't like kids taking on a scary monster?", "Totally love it, funny + scary = great horror film!", "was a bore. It felt like a mini series squeezed into a movie and still managed to be boring. The story and editing were clunky.", "when when a clown comes to town and the kids have to run amok to solve this mystery they decide to do things that most kids wouldn't do they stay away from parents and they do not get too scared it's a scary movie but the clown is beautiful really see it for the clown and don't look in the sewer today thank you", "This is my first time reviewing on Rotten Tomatoes and I have to admit, I am excited! I first watched the original IT miniseries back in the early nineties when I was just a teenager. I have always had an affinity for suspense driven horror films. That being said, I have slept since then and when I watched the movie opening day, I FRIGGIN LOVED IT! Not having too much recollection of the miniseries allowed me to view this film with fresh eyes and an objective perspective. Pennywise provides a creepy yet occasionally endearing character (Reference Georgie), while the group of young kids who band together to create the Losers Club does an outstanding job of providing the audience with many fun and traditional horror movie clich\u00e9s. You know these kids are running directly towards danger and you cannot help but yell at their naivet\u00e9 from the edge of your seat! I am now officially terrified of red balloons...  The comradery and almost innate connection between the kids of the Losers Club is simply superb! This film echoes many of the unsuspected and unusual relationship bonds seen in movies such as Stand by Me, The Goonies, Super 8, ET, and television's Stranger Things.   If you can watch this movie objectively and with youthful eyes, you will enjoy it! IT is one of my top movies of the year and I cannot wait to watch it again before Halloween. In regards to suspenseful, creepy, and somewhat compelling story telling, IT hits all the marks. The audience was fully engaged and immersed in the experience which made viewing this film both nostalgic and tons of fun!", "IT is a well-done horror movie. Bill Skarsg\u013ard played Pennywise perfectly, he really achieves to disturb and frighten the viewer. The movie goes by a great pace, and there are no \"cheap jump scares\". Sometimes the characters make dumb decisions, like in every \"classical\" horror movie but they are kids so it is understandable.  Overall great movie, I would recommend it to all horror movie fans.", "The kids definitely made this movie. They were funny. The new Pennywise is definitely more creepy looking then the original.", "The remake IT blew the 90's adaptation out of the water! The actor Bill was both terrifying and has earned Mr. King's respect as PennyWise. While not sticking entirely to the book, and making slight changes, the movie came out to be something even greater that exceeded high expectations. It is so good, I saw the movie twice as Mr. King did. This movie deserves an A++.", "It shoes your actual fears.", "This is a perfectly-crafted coming-of-age horror movie. Why? Because we can relate to any and all of these Losers. When you have an ensemble cast this large, and each character feels like a three-dimensional human being, then you know that everything has fallen into place, from the writing, the acting, the story, and the directing. It doesn't matter if you know that certain things are going to happen; they're frightening nonetheless because *we believe the characters are frightened* as well.   The 1990 tv miniseries was an achievement in and of itself: a horror story with heart that took place over two stages in life. This 2017 cinematic remake only tackles the first part, but it accomplishes two things: 1) it was a complete movie in and of itself, regardless of the sequel, and 2) it was so good, it (and IT) made me excited at the continuation of this story with these characters.", "Just back from \"It.\" It was decent! I think since I\\'ve read the book several times and seen the original TV miniseries several times that it may have lessened the experience a bit, since I knew where things were going. No helping that, I suppose, so I\\'ll focus on the cast. Great kid actors bringing the roles to life. Maybe speaks to my desensitization of watching so many horror movies over the years, but the film wasn\\'t really scary to me. Oh sure, some jumps here and there, and I appreciate the overall creepiness and skeeviness that Andr\u00e9s Muschietti is able to bring to the otherwise sunny Maine town. Some weird humor here and there, though, that kind of took me out of it. If anything, I was kind of hoping the film would be more relentless at times. Oh well.  Of course, the major elephant in the room is Bill Skarsg\u013ard as Pennywise. He of course had the probably impossible task of living up to Tim Curry\\'s iconic performance in the original TV series. That being said, I thought he did a good job in finding his own way in the role and making it pretty creepy himself. I think this film made me appreciate the 1990 miniseries a bit more since the latter had to pull off King\\'s work on network television, not an easy task back then. (Way before \"American Horror Story\", kids.)  So, overall, PAHM (Perfectly Acceptable Horror Movie). Didn\\'t insult my intelligence and stayed pretty true to the maestro\\'s original work. We\\'ll see what they do with the sequel.   (My movie companion tonight, Yvonne Alles, had this to say: \"It reminds me of \\'Stranger Things.\\' Well, yeah, Mom, the Duffer Brothers pretty much owe their career to King. :) Would have been interesting to see what they would have done with it when they were attached at one point.  SCORE: 8/10 IMDB, 4/5 stars RT.", "horrifying with an even mix of comedy", "This is more scary than the mini-series version.", "so good very scary band funny.", "not an improvement from the original as not like the book. Pretty disappointing and needless reboot ruined by CGI", "This was a good horror film with various types of scares, so there is something creepy for everyone to enjoy. I plan to see it again. looking forward to part 2.", "It's a terrible movie. It's not scary nor entreateining. Too much publicity for nothing", "I prefer the original one.", "Best remake in a long long time, had my heart beating like a gym session !!!", "Such a good movie and i love how they get along so great with each other", "Spectacularly horrorific, from the start. There are also many layers to this film, that create a much deeper story, than just some BS monster movie. The first scene definitely captures you because of it's unreal gruesomeness. A+ movie.", "A really good movie but unfortunately it didn't really bring the scares I had hoped for. It's strange that I enjoyed it so much even though it wasn't really that scary I still have to give it 5 stars. It was a little long but I personally didn't' mind the length as much as I did the uncomfortable theater seating.", "The kids were entertaining, and funny, the clown was comical at best. He reminded me of an old Bugs Bunny Roadrunner cartoon.", "Me encanto la actuaci\u00f3n de los ni\u0144os, excelente sonido y el \"it\" tan bueno como el primero, todo excelente", "Awful movie!! How can you possibly call children bullying and an undertone of pedophilia...Intertainment.. Would like to know, if Kings 3 children allow their kids to view..", "BY far the best horror movie I've ever scene, the cast was incredible, the action scenes were true and funny,and most importantly it had heart and will be known as a classic", "In one of the most faithful Stephen King adaptations, IT proves you can make a horror movie at the same time as making a great movie in general. Asides from being a good horror movie it is also a great coming of age movie. Like Stranger Things, IT pays homage to 80s cinema. Whether it be The Goonies or Stand by Me, you see the love Muschietti has for 80s movies.  Director Andy Muschietti showed he can make an effective horror movie with \"Mama\", but with IT he shows the ability to bring out the comedy in these scary moments. The biggest surprise for me though Is the performances he gets out of these child actors. Each one has their moment to shine. The standout performance among the kids though is from Sophia Lillis as Beverly. The performance that should not be ignored though is Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. Pennywise in 2017 is much different from Tim Curry\\'s in 1990. Curry\\'s was designed to look like a friendly clown so it made sense for kids to follow him but Skarsgard\\'s doesn\\'t look friendly at all. Skarsgard though looks like he is having a lot of fun with this role.   My biggest negative is that I would have preferred more organic scares instead of using music cues and jump scares. To me it comes off as lazy. My only other complaint is some of the writing. I found some of the dialogue to be clunky at times and some characters not being fully developed.  Overall, IT was a solid movie with a well executed story with great performances from the key players. Though the movie was not as scary I had hoped, IT was a better movie than what I expected.  Final Score: 4/5 or 8/10", "Well, this movie certainly put the fear of clowns in me. Looking forward to part 2.", "One of my all-time favorite movies! I've seen it 10 times since opening weekend and I still can't get enough of it! It's full of action, suspense, great scares, and some of the best comedy I've seen come from child actors. The acting, for the most part, is really well done and the chemistry between characters is really great. I can't wait to see this one again this weekend! Come join me, you'll float too ;)", "IT was a really sick, hideous and very violet horror movie! Kids did lots of dangerous violence scenes and I was shocked and amazed! Clown was really creepy and scary. I t reminded me Nightmare on Elm Street, Stand by Me and John Carpenter's The Thing. I expected great horror movie, but IT was just OK...", "Aside from jump and false scares, and needless over-done CGI, not bad", "Slow paced at first, but promising halfway through till the end. IT brings a breath of fresh air into the horror genre, it veers away from the horror stereotype and I'm only saying this because I haven't seen the original. Even when it resorts to jump scares, it does it well in the sense that it is unpredictable and that's what's charming about good horror, fear of the unknown.", "it was a great film very close to the novel I can't wait to see chapter 2", "One of the worst movies I've seen in years. Characters that you didn't care about. No ability to build suspense. Terrible art direction (could the scary house be any more cliche). Nothing about this movie was good. The cinematigrapggy was atrocious. The shot with the covered bridge at the end was composed randomly. No twists. They even managed to not use the sped up movement technique well. Truly pathetic.", "Malisima.  Mucho mejor la de 1990", "A fantastic revival of Stephen King's masterpiece book. A heart-gripping thriller that will take you to a chilling ride into the abyss of your soul.Andy Muschietti's direction and the movie screenplay's fluidity, are evenly matched by the child actors' great performances. IT's frightful visceral story, will take you back to the small town of Derry at the late 80's, and permeate you with questions about morality, personality issues and tabboos, leaving you indagating about society, human nature and who the true villains are in the end..  Cherry-topping it all.. Bill Skarsgard's unsettling and unique deliverance of Pennywise is highly creepy and remarkable. Worth of watching in every way possible. 4.5/5", "I'm not denying the effort here but the original movie version has stole hearts in our childhood it was scary for a whole generation it's old but magically gold", "I'm not denying the effort here but still the original movie has stolen hearts in our childhood it was chilling for a whole generation  old but magical gold", "Well crafted and creepy horror that, where as the original did not, inspired in me the desire to read the original book. If you like horror you will most likely enjoy this film.", "Expertly made visuals bring Stephen King's wild imagination to life, Bill Skarsg\u013ard is one with the role of Pennywise and Finn Wolfhard is given some great, funny one-liners and shoots them impeccably. What kept this from being an enduring film though is that not only the writers didn't steer away from certain obvious clich\u00e9s but also that they didn't invest enough in their characters, for the most part degrading them to those typical 'outsider' kids we've all seen a million times before.", "Do I laugh? Do I fear? Why would the kid go down there solo?! Illogical. Meh.   SPOILER:  The kids learned how to dismiss Pennywise too soon. How you can we have a PART 2 when the 'fear' is no longer there?", "This movie was perfect outstanding based on the novel by Stephen King. I mean the actor that play Pennywise in this film, he did an amazing job and spot on! The story was great, the characters are awesome and memorable, the acting was great, and the camera work was great with their angles! I will give this movie a solid 80% on Rotten Tomatoes.", "'It', whilst not being one of the scariest movies I've seen, earns its stripes by being one of the weirdest, most original ones in a long time. It's often unpredictable, and the mystery behind Pennywise himself is one of the most captivating aspects of the movie. But aside from Pennywise the clown himself, the rest of the cast is also great - likely the best acting I've seen from child actors anywhere. The protagonists were so good and that made the movie all the more believable and engaging, as seeing children going through what they go through is refreshingly different, in a macabre type of way. I absolutely look forward to the sequel.", "Good horror film....well done justice was done to the original.", "Summary: It was a pleasant surprise, probably one of the most memorable horror films I\\'ve seen in the past 5 years. 86/100 [B+]  First of all, it\\'s great to be back with you guys after almost 3 years of zero reviews. So moving on, I was not expecting this movie to be good at all, the trailers did not convince me and it did not look scary at all to me. But holly hell! I did not do any research about this movie so when it started to get many attention and praise from critics I was interested. So I found out later that the guy who directed Mama made this. I liked that film in general, so I was even more excited. Anyway let\\'s get to the film. This review will contain minor spoilers if you haven\\'t see the film. I will not reveal anything too important.  I was really surprised with the opening scene, the movie introduces us to Georgie and his brother and then we move on to... that scene. Pennywise looks scary as hell and his dialogue is funny at the same time also the saliva coming out from his mouth adds a little creepy touch to that specific scene. Then we move on to the rest of the first act which introduces us to these kids and their bullies, this movie does a great job developing its main characters which are performed by many talented kids who did an excellent, magnificent work on their roles.  It was pretty cool to see the individual scary scenes with the red balloons for each kid, all of this moments packed many jumps and jolts which I found extremely well directed. I noticed that this movie still keeps the \"Mama\" flavor from director Andy Muschietti. Both films have similar creepy imagery and effects. Both movies look very similar in style, color and art direction, I absolutely loved that the movie kept that aspect. I cannot wait to watch more films coming from him.  The second act is slick, dreadful, a brutal explosion of blood (literally). I loved every second of it, my movie theatre was screaming and laughing all at once during this act. This is definitely one of the best movie theatre experiences I\\'ve ever had. The projector scene was so freaking good, (I will not spoil anything) let\\'s just say that it is one of the best moments in a horror movie in years. Also, my favorite scene was the first bathroom scene with the incredibly talented Sophia Lillis (Beverly), her screams and overall performance during that scene was mind-blowing.  Another moment from the movie which involves a scary looking house was very intense too. It was one of the sequences who got the most gripping reaction from my audience. Muschietti directs with energy, it is a sea of memorable scares and surprises. Oh, man this movie has so many great moments! Also, the film does a great job mixing the comedy and horror aspects together. When the film is doing horror it\\'s scary, and when it is doing comedy it\\'s hilarious. Mainly because of the genius and sleek dialogue between the characters.  I want to stand out Nicholas Hamilton\\'s performance as the bully guy (Henry). He did a fantastic job and he was very scary in every moment he was on screen. I actually felt very frustrated as the characters themselves. I also felt a great connection between the characters, there was good chemistry among them. That beautifully scary house sequence left me breathless, because it\\'s the moment where shit\\'s going down. The moment where everything goes to hell, amazingly orchestrated by Muschietti.  Third act is shaky but still fun. I wish it did not have all of that shaky cam during the final fight, it was very difficult to see what was going on. It was similar to what happened with the horror/action scenes in the movie Krampus, way too dark and shaky. But whatever it was still entertaining. The resolution of the film was very accurate, I was very happy with the ending and I cannot wait to see the sequel which I hope is as good as this film.  As with flaws I would say that it takes some time for the film to start the horror aspect. It takes a lot of time to develop these characters. But I don\\'t complain after all, movies need great character development. Another minor flaw I have is some of the VFX used in the film, in a couple of moments they look kind of weird. But hey! It\\'s from the same guy who directed \"Mama\" so I get why he decided to use that type of strange CGI in this film. Anyway, this is one of my favorite horror movies in the past 5 years. It is so extremely well directed, acted and shot. It has so many memorable horror moments and it definitely deserves to be the highest grossing horror film to date! [B+]", "Stephen King la public\u00f3 en 1986 y de no ser por eso dir\u00eda que estaba viendo un cap\u00edtulo como flojo de \"Stranger Things\". Habr\u00eda que leer la novela, pero todo parece indicar que la suavizaron mucho. Es buena por que es terror del cl\u00e1sico, pero es aburrida porque es tan cl\u00e1sico que es del todo predecible, el cuento del payaso funcionaba muy bien en los 80s pero hoy en d\u00eda esta muy machacado.

So there are definitely many horror elements that I am not the best judge of. However, IT was extremely well done in my opinion. It didn't rely on cheap shock and terror. Instead, it really developed the story and the characters. IT was more of a coming of age movie set in a horror movie backdrop than a traditional horror movie. Director Andy Muschietti did an amazing job not trying to push the story, but let it unfold slowly and kept the audience at the edge of their seats. Bill Skarsgard did a fantastic job as Pennywise with his limited screen time. All the child actors exceeded my expectations as well. Overall, IT was carefully written, directed, and acted. It is definitely worth a watch.", "The movie is not really horror because of the clown. The clown was more funny than scary.", "excellent a great enjoyable film", "It was good. Great atmosphere, soundtrack. interpretations. I didn't find it very scary, but I think that's the point, it's not a horror movie. I liked the changes in the story, but not the ones made with Ben and Mike. I was good, but nothing special. I was too hyped, maybe. I didn't enjoyed that much.", "this movie was Brilliant", "In my opinion, this is honestly the greatest movie I have seen in such a long time.", "Characters, special effects, story, everything is amazing!!", "Awesomely fun movie. Better than the original in my opinion", "90% Stranger Things, 5% 1990 movie, and only 5% book material. Nah. I'll pass.

The connection with the book existed there, at least. I absolutely hate all this Stranger Things fever.", "well , its a stephen kings classic horror adaption. once again it proves that stephen kings adaptaion is the best for horror movie. really a frightening movie . i think 2017 best horror movie. very good making and very good character build-up. very good film.", "This move is a must see if you just want to get scared. However, if you are not a fan of the book, don't bother. I am giving this 4 stars because I wanted to be scared, and the film did just that. I found myself backing away from the screen....in a movie theater....where you can't get away from the screen unless you close your eyes. It was horrifying! Got me at so many moments. However, the reason for no 5 star is because this film, just like many others, does not go by the book at all. There is alot of things left out. I feel the only reason I understood everything, was from watching the original IT. Now that I will say is a must see if you are looking for the book in movie form. So for scares a 4. Definitely see if you are looking for straight up horror. Aa for book fans, don't bother. Not worth your time.", "One of the worst. It was like a bad after school movie that wanted to be scary.

Although I enjoyed most of the film, I wasn\\'t sure about some of the script and editorial decisions as it seems they tried too hard to make it different.

I definitely recommend it!", "When I first heard of the It remake, I groaned inside. Why would they need to do this? I never saw the mini series starring Tim Curry, and had virtually no interest watching it anytime soon, so I had no attachment to the source material. After seeing a trailer or two though, I had to admit I was interested, but I still thought the film hinged on the clown, who I wasn't sure about, having never really seen Bill Skarsgard in anything. After viewing the film, I can say I was thoroughly satisfied. Skarsgard is unnerving and yet eccentric as Pennywise, and the effects were very well done. The child actors are all very good in this film too, and it should be exciting to see where else they end up in the future. My two biggest flaws are this; the film is certainly extremely tense and suspenseful, but never truly scared me, also I truly think it could've benefited greatly from an extra 15-45 minutes showing the backstory of Derry and more character moments for the losers club. While the character moments were very well done, I wanted to see more and I thought they felt a bit rushed as a result. However, the second half of the story is coming and I am 100% in for it", "Me encanto, realmente me gusto como le dieron frescura a este remake. Mucho mas grotesca que la pel\u00edcula de 1990.", "IT is one of my favorite movies out at the moment because of the great acting, special effects, and intriguing plot. The actor who played Pennywise, Bill Skarsg\u013ard, did an amazing job at the role. He was great at being the just the right amount of creepy and has reinstated my fear of clowns. Jaeden Lieberher also did an amazing job at the role of Bill and portraying his character development. The character Bil has a stutter and it slowly gets better the less afraid he is and Jaeden did a great job portraying that characteristic. All the members of the Losers Club in the movie did an amazing job in the scenes with IT and showing genuine fear and made me sympathize with them easily. The actors get five out of five stars. The special effects were amazing especially with the great job they did with Pennywise's face. The makeup was marvelous and the CGI. When Pennywise gets his big teeth the work done on that part is amazing and very realistic. The special effects get five out of five stars. The story line and plot was also magnificent. The movie was adapted from the Stephen King book very well. Of course the writers of the movie couldn't fit every part of the book in but they did get never the less the plot was very interesting and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time.

I went with a friend to see it and for the most part we either fell asleep or were just laughing. BORING..... The movie dragged that was a huge waste of time and money. The best part of the entire movie was the first 5 minutes", "Not scary at all. Was a comedy more than anything", "Bravo, never saw the original though... lol", "Despite not having many effective scares, this is a fantastic modern classic. The acting surprised me the most, with fantastic performances coming from almost all of the leading actors (and actress). IT may fail to deliver in the scare department, but the themes of coming of age and friendship, as well as a frightening but emotional story at its core, makes this, in my opinion, the best film of this year. (Don't rant at me, this is 100% my opinion, and I'm fully aware that films like Wonder Woman and Get Out came out this year, which are definitely all 5 star movies too. If there were less jumpscares, and it kept the more effective ones, I would go as far as to say IT is one of my favourite films I've ever seen.) Congratulations to everyone involved!", "I had no interest in seeing this, but decided I had to check it out after hearing rave reviews -- and I loved IT! An entertaining mix of scares, humor, and just enough heart.  Grade: A+", "It was mostly a comedy jump out scarry movie", "Scare Factor 4/5   Every jump scare kept the audience on their toes and as a person who enjoys horror movies, I had so much anxiety every five minutes. Although, the scene where Pennywise was dancing while making an intense straight face was more hilarious than scary.   Unique Characters 5/5   Richie made hilarious jokes that kept the audience laughing every five minutes and at times I would forget that I was watching a horror movie. Each character had parts of their background revealed through the fears that Pennywise turned into when he encountered them. Although, some characters such as Beverly had more screen time when it came to revealing their dark past or current issues that they struggle with throughout the movie. For example, they revealed that the father attempts to molest her in the house more than once.   Plot 3/5   The plot was predictable at times, but it even though the audience was still able to predict when Pennywise would appear, the tension would continuously build up. For example, during the scene when Pennywise jumped out of the screen in front of the projector, it scared me because I didn't think he was going to become a giant version of himself.   Acting 5/5   The actors were genuinely scared because one of the actors, Finn Wolfhard, had an actual fear of clowns and when he filmed the clown scene, he was extremely terrified. All of the actors overall completely embraced their character to the point where it would be hard to see them as normal people in real life because you can't look at them the same. All of their emotions looked completely authentic on the screen and their face completely embodied that fear every time Pennywise appeared.   The overall score of the movie is a 17 out of 20.   The strengths of this movie were the acting and characters. The weaknesses of this movie were just the plot.", "Coming-of-age + Goonies = It. It is an adventure movie about some kids in school, growing up and dealing with there everyday issues (aka bullies, girls, family), and at the same time trying to figure out the mistery of the clown. Dont get me wrong, the clown scenes are very good and scary, that gives you goosebumps. The problem for me is the expectation. I was expecting an horror movie.. and its not. Its a good aventure movie, the kids interact very well, solid acting from all the cast and a nice plot by all means. I did not liked the running time... the movie drags and drags and drags.... some scenes are just boring.. At least 20mns I would cut from it.", "Less a film about a killer clown and more a story of adolescent struggle and community of youth, IT has an emotional core tangled in it's horrifying premise. The Stephen King notes are present and respected throughout, the film is more like Stand By Me but with a clown. The young actors are phenomenal particularly Finn Wolfhard and Sophia Lillis who frame the group and Bill Skasgard gives an early career defining stand as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, a role intimidating to take over after Tim Curry's brilliant performance in the original two part TV series, however Skasgard did brilliantly. The film appeals to all audiences and I was glad to see that it didn't skimp on some of the harsher parts in the book and definitely upped the ante in terms of dealing with the taboo of dead children. The only thing I would say is that it's unfortunately not as memorable as the original due to having no real satisfying conclusion, I believe that IT is a film that is definitely supposed to be viewed in two parts, one after the other, because otherwise it leaves an unsatisfying lingering after the film is over. Roll on part 2!", "Better than the original movie, not nearly as good as the book.", "Not as sold on this one as a lot of people are, but I enjoyed it overall. It's very well-acted, there are some splendid visuals, and it took me back to my own childhood, which spanned the 1980s. But it lacks a certain sense of dread, and it repeatedly stops short of going to those REALLY dark places that the best horror films aren't afraid of going to. I feel like the filmmakers were too worried about losing the mass audience and so toned down some of the most disturbing elements of the novel. Also: there's WAY too much music. I dunno, it feels more like a made-for-TV movie in a lot of ways than a proper feature film. Maybe Chapter 2 will go deeper and darker. Let's hope so. As it stands, I think this is a solid, though not outstanding, horror outing.", "It is like watching Jaws relentless hunting the gang from Goonies", "IT is all there. If you look for IT.", "I enjoyed it. The dialogue had a good balance of humor to balance out the heavy topic of kids being abducted by a homicidal monster. Nice update to an older Steven King story.", "\"It\" was a fantastic film. I scored the movie based on the acting of the cast, how scary the content was, the believability of the effects used and the overall plot. I gave the acting of the cast a 5 out of 5 stars; despite the main characters being children, they were able to bring the story to life in a phenomenal way. As for how scary the content was, this category was given a 5 out 5 stars. The creators balanced out the amount of scary aspects with suspense, comedy and emotional aspects. Personally, if a movie has too much of a scare factor, it is harder for me to watch; \"It\" did an amazing job of finding the in-between in terms of horror elements. In terms of effects, I would give this category a 4 out of 5 stars. Most of the effects were well done, but at certain points featuring the clown\\'s transformations, there seemed to be an odd use of CGI. This is most likely a personal preference, but other than that, the effects were believable and added to the horror aspect of \"It.\" Finally, I gave the overall plot of It a 5 out 5 stars. The story follows a group of children who come together in order to fight their worst fears as friends; the plot is incredibly gripping and also has an emotional edge throughout the film. As a whole, I would give \"It\" 5 out of 5 stars; despite my dislike of the CGI performance, every other criteria I have for films has been met. Every sequence of the movie was well acted and kept me on the edge of my seat.", "Its a good movie but only two scenes made me jump", "i found the clown very digitalizied. I prefer the original one with only make up...", "Part 1 is very good, but this story/movie is best measured as a whole.", "I left this movie more bewildered than anything. It literally took me hours to process how I felt about it (no pun intended) Let me start by saying was a really good movie, but it wasn\\'t great. It didn\\'t leave me satisfied.   Here\\'s why. The primary reason was Pennywise was waaaay underused. There were only three scenes where he had dialogue, and when he did actually act Bill whatever his last name was amazing. He put Tim Curry to shame. But the filmmakers decided to short changed him by going the shape shifting route, which I was never really a fan of in the original. Pennywise and the musical score is what made \"it\" scary. I didn\\'t read the novel, but this movie comes off as a novel with its focus on the character development. It is reminiscent of \"Stand by Me\" and \"Stranger Things\", and that\\'s why I think people loved it so much.   It was a very well made movie. The cinematography was beautiful. Editing was seamless. The hints of 80 nostalgia brought a little extra oomph to it.   The performances were solid. However, the original losers club had more \"it\" factor. Especially when it came to the Bill kid who was first cast as that child star who killed himself later in life. The new Bill has no charmisa whatsoever. Beverly was the best out of the kids, her performance was compelling. Eddie became my favorite out of the bunch as he seemed to stand out amongst the losers.   The soundtrack is nothing iconic. It had a couple effective jump scares. And some others that didn\\'t work at all. They needed to rethink some of their execution with Pennywise terrorizing them. There were a few moments that were suppose to be scary but came off stupid.  I waited over a year to see this movie. Was super excited and saw the first showing today. This is more of a character driven piece about fear rather than scary clown stalking and eating kids. I would actually give this movie a higher rating but feel it\\'s score of 91 is undeserved therefore lowering my grade to tip the scale to a more accurate score.", "What a great movie this was, already been to the cinema to watch it the second time. Remakes aren?t usually better than the original, but in this case they managed to pull it off.", "Lame!!!!!!! no new tricks. Tim Curry was way better.", "Whoever decided to add an evil clown to this Stand by Me remake deserves a raise.", "The movie was amazing, absolutely terrifying &amp; I couldn't stop holding my face in fear, the cast took the new version to a whole other level, I can honestly say it's better than the origional. Bill Skarsgard does the new Pennywise justice &amp; Tim curry would be proud, would definitely reccomend you go &amp; see it, but not before watching the origional then you have something to compare it to.", "Very good despite the author being a douche.", "A coming of age story with scares and laughs.", "A fun horror movie that, while being a bit over edited and over scored, is still effective. For the most part, the performances were impressive all across the board. Much of the horror imagery was quite scary; sometimes I didn't get the opportunity to look at it long enough, but I digress.  Andy Muschietti did a good job with good material. It's rare to see a horror film that is an event anymore, and this one certainly qualifies. I'll support that no matter what. Horror is almost always better in a packed house.", "Es entretenida, el final es lo que m\u00e1s me gusto. Pero no soporto pel\u00edculas con ni\u0144os, pq nunca hubo FBI buscando a los desaparecidos?, pq no los mata IT desde un principio? En fin merece m\u00e1s un precuela q una secuela.", "A movie that does justice to the original! Though more of a psychological thriller than a horror film, it proves that a movie in modern society can actually be scary, thought-provoking, and funny.", "Be forewarned, what follows is actually closer to an analysis than a simple review, concerning as it does the first of a two part adaptation of Stephen Kings 1300+ page, mega masterpiece and my personal favourite novel not just from the master horror writer, but possibly my favourite book ever, so there was always going to be a lot for me to say about it, i was always going to inspect not just every scene and moment but every detail, every fraction of this movie in comparison to the novel, just so you are prepared for what is to come. So you have my permission to either jump ship now (i wouldn\\'t blame you, this is going to be fucking indulgent at best, meandering at worst) or if you\\'re in, then abandon hope all ye who enter here, i\\'ll try and keep it all shorter than the book on which the movie is based. So, there i was, sitting in the exact middle of the Imax Odeon screen in Greenwich, the movie that i had been anticipating possibly more than any other movie in my 28 years of cinema going aside from Ghostbusters 2 in 1989 (which funny enough is when this movie is set) a movie i had poured over every production photo, every tiny morsel of info, i sat nervously stuffing salted caramel popcorn into my mouth which was a terrible choice of cinema food, a piece got stuck in my throat and i had to run to the loo, stick my fingers down my throat and chunder it loose, after the ordeal i staggered back into the screen room, acidic vom taste in my mouth, a sat down and tried to wash the taste down with grossly overpriced cinema coke, and then it began. Of course it all begins with the already iconic \"storm drain scene\", which most people will be aware of from the now iconic (but hugely fucking flawed) Tim Curry starring miniseries, this whole opening portion of the movie is goddamn fucking perfect, every beat is right, every detail, the flourishes that director Andy Muschietti graces the movie with are beautiful, the dread filled and foreboding way that the smiley face poor little Georgie draws on the window pane\\'s condensation fades away is chilling as hell, and theres a touch of Spielberg in Georgie running through the rain chasing his paper boat (the object of his doom) as it sails along in the rain, and the scene between the doomed child and Pennywise The Dancing Clown, beckoning him to the storm drain, is for me already one of the most chilling, gut wrenching scenes in a horror movie this decade. Mention must first go to Bill Skarsgard as the new iteration of Pennywise, he is phenomenal, it doesnt even feel like there is a human actor under there sometimes, the choices he makes in the performance and the little touches are genius (the drool hanging off his chin, that voice) the way the jolly facade briefly drops at one point is terrifying, you can almost see this animal underneath, the feral, dirty thing that only wants this little boys flesh, and the payoff to the scene is, well, even the book was slightly less cruel and horrific, it\\'s unusual to see a child get killed so blatantly on screen, being the last true taboo there is, but the way they play events out here is gut wrenching and even upsetting. Sadly the movie is never this good, scary, close to the book or effective again. But, let me say out of the gate, i love this film, it\\'s great, an epic, fun, funny, bloody, sweet, thrilling and massively entertaining blast, but it\\'s just not the book. This movie opts for more of a spooky, funhouse rollercoaster ride through Kings haunting, terrifying, sad, ballsy, and deeply meaningful novel, to put it another way, i was hoping with this two parter to get the Godfather part 1+2 of horror movies, but instead i got the KillBill Volume 1+2 of horror, still great, but not the more powerful, raw and affecting epic i was hoping for. The thing that creates the most trouble out of the gate, is changing the setting from the late 50\\'s of the kids stuff in the book to the late 80\\'s, and the adult portion\\'s from the mid 80\\'s to the mid, whatever the fuck this lost, decadent, horrible nightmare of a decade is referred to. This change does bring events in to my nostalgic childhood of 1989 but it guts out a gigantic chunk of the book\\'s essence, so so much is lost, like the pop cultural references from the 1950\\'s and so much of what the ear informs on the plot and the way the kids are. But the biggest and most hard to take loss is the parade of 50\\'s movie monsters Pennywise turns into, creatures that haunted the nightmares of kids of the time like The Wolfman, Frankenstein\\'s Monster, Dracula, The Creature From The Black Lagoon and The Mummy (although he does make a quick appearance at the climax) all of these cool forms are gone, replaced by apparitions that are effectively creepy (the woman in the painting is nightmare fuel) but far less exciting or cool than what could have been, in fact the only other form that remains from the book is the leper, which here is rendered enjoyably grotesque but not particularly scary, whereas the scene in the book is skin crawling (the leper asks Eddie if he would like a blowjob when he appears from under the porch, here he just appears and chases after Eddie, blah!). Why Muschietti didint think it was unbelievably exciting to indulge in a creature that is not just one monster but can be any monster, is beyond me, it\\'s the main bugbear for me and one that no amount of overpriced cinema coke will wash down the bitter taste of. On the other hand, they nail the late 80\\'s, i was there so, id know, the feel, the atmosphere, the details like the rising popularity of hiphop, New Kids On The Block, Henry Bowers mullet, kids playing in places they shouldn\\'t, a raw unrequited infatuation with THAT girl who makes you\\'re tummy feel funny for some reason, the fear, excitement, adventure of being a kid at that time, and the allure and terror of the influence of horror movies of the time around the edges of everyday events (posters for A Nightmare On Elm Street 5, Beetlejuice and Gremlins are seen) Streetfighter at the arcade, a Walkman. Even that fear of going somewhere in you\\'re house that scares you, in my case up stairs to fetch my sisters doll from a darkened room for her whilst we were sitting down watching \"Salem\\'s Lot\" with my dad (yep, people didnt give a shit about kids in the 80\\'s) in 1988, strangely enough the same year that Georgie meets his fate, although i fared much better thankfully, i still have all my limbs. The 80\\'s extends to the feel of the movie too, it evokes perfectly movies like The Monster Squad, Poltergeist and A Nightmare On Elm Street beautifully, i love the way this movie brings back that sense of gory funhouse enjoyment of 80\\'s horror movies to the extent that it is one of those movies, id say that more than any other one of the dozens of 80\\'s homageing movies or tv shows of the last decade (including Stranger Things) only The Guest and this film has captured the true feeling and tone of those films without feeling fake. The other sort of movies from that era this movie most feels spiritually in tune with are kids adventure films like The Goonies (and this movie is pretty much a dark horror version of The Goonies) Explorers and Stand By Me especially, it potently remids one of the times when kids movies were more raw and scary, more true to how kids can be (rude, foulmouthed, uncontrollable and obnoxious) how much less safe and sterilised those films were, it feels like the return to those sort of kids adventure flicks that Super 8 wanted to be but fumbled, and Stranger Things was but to a lesser extent, in fact i see this being a high watermark horror flick for kids now, like what Poltergeist was to us, a kind of gateway drug horror to darker r-rated thrills, and proper, edgier kids adventure with the stabilisers off, and for that i love it most. Speaking of the kids, one of the movies strongest suits is the child cast, The Losers Club was always going to be the most important element (more than Pennywise even) and they fucking nailed it big time, not since the aforementioned Goonies or Stand By Me have kids felt this much like actual kids, in fcat this is the best kids ensemble since those films, they\\'re so good that in 20 years time they\\'ll all be brought back for retrospectives on the movie. Best of the bunch is the positively glowing Sophia Lillis as Beverley Marsh, an instant star if ever i saw one, she is amazing, tough, lovely and cool as hell the only false note is the strange choice to make her a damsel in distress at the climax, which is a terribly regressive thing to do to the only girl of the group and pissed me off if im honest. Jeremy Ray Taylor is simply perfect, he may be smaller than i imagine the character to be, but he\\'s Ben Hanscom through and through, sweet, warm and lovable and exuding the decency and good nature of the character beautifully. The brilliantly named Finn Wolfhard (should be an action star when her grows up with that name) is also the perfect Richie \"Trashmouth\" Tozier, he\\'s more harsh and a fair bit more obnoxious than the character in the book, but he nails it, he\\'s the constant source of the movies surprisingly plentiful laughs (this film is really damn funny) he\\'s a hilarious, foul mouthed delight. Jack Dylan Grazer is the other source of much hilarity as hypochondriac Eddie Kaspbrak, he\\'s the Eddie of the book but with a bit more sass and mouth to him that makes him the perfect foil for Richie. Jaeden Liberher is a fine Bill Denbrough, he projects a sheer likeability and inner strength that is integral to Bill, plus he nails the stutter, but in changing the nature of Bills journey (in the book Georgies body in found and it sets Bill off on a quest for revenge, here Georgie is never found so it instead becomes for Bill a search for his missing brother) they rob Bill of much of his nobility and bravery, and the directness of his, and other Losers mission to outright kill this monster, is gone, instead it\\'s a bit more uncertain what they hope to achieve by going unarmed into the haunted house on Neibolt Street, also we see that Georgie is in no way going to turn up alive unless the film pulls a bizzare, shark jumping plot turn, so we\\'re left knowing more than Bill, making his story a bit dramatically uninteresting. Chosen Jacobs does what he can with what he\\'s given as Mike Hanlon, but the treatment of his character, the only African American of the group, is troubling, in the book he is the scholar character who delves into the history of the curse town of Derry (more of this rich, disturbing backstory would be more than welcome in the seocnd part please) they instead give his characteristics to Ben, leaving him a sort of dramatic vacuum, even his early set up of an arc (with the bolt gun) is stolen by Bill, and the horrific racial abuse met out to him by psycho bully Henry Bowers (Nicolas Hamilton, like an evil River Phoenix, boiled down to being just a one note bully, he\\'s still a memorable screen bully and sometimes scarier than Pennywise) is toned down massively, robbing him of his generational struggle with the racial issues of America that are still at large and would have been very relevant and, with his joining with the white Losers, very positive element for these sad post Trump times, a sad missed opportunity. Wyatt Oleff is the real weak link overall as milquetoast Stan Uris, but maybe that suits the character, and really thats the way he\\'s written, he gives a decent enough performance but leaves the smallest impact of the gang. In terms of performances, once again i must go into Bill Skarsgards Pennywise, he puts on a show of a performance, a wild, unhinged thing, incredibly strange and visually nightmarish presence that pops up every so often like a cackling, malevolent jack in a box, he more than matches Curry\\'s towering role with a portrayal that\\'s just as iconic. Back to the various changes made to the text, one of the other biggest losses is aforementioned the rich and dark backstory of Derry, told in episodic flashbacks in the book and almost totally ommited here aside from some choice references (a mural of The Bradley Gang Shootout, a brilliantly crafted scare built around \"The Kitchener Ironwork\\'s Explosion\" from the book that claims 88 kids lives) that imaginative detail would have lent an even more epic, expansive scope to the movie and the loss of these touches is a shame, maybee next time. Other changes are to the almost science fictiony fantasy madness from the books duel climax (the kid Losers and the grown up Losers going back to the sewers is intercut, almost like psychic time travel) no turtle gods or giant spiders here im afraid. But the climax is still big and impressive in a way that modern horror never is, with a real big budget blockbuster feel that is the opposite of the Bulmhouse generation, this is epic, expansive and ambitious horror stuff. It feel like an event film. So yeah overall, despite all the painful omissions and changes, this is a great movie, a big, fun, scary, funhouse horror ride with great characters and performances, terrific direction, gorgeous cinematography from Park Chan Wooks cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung giving it a look that is far more rich and textured than any other horror around, and a beautiful and often perfectly judged score by Benjamin Wallfisch, indeed this is a horror movie of unusual craft and care. And with the addition of the second part we could end up with a genre landmark, and a classic, the second aprt could bring home the many parts that make this not quite the full fat experience i hoped for, but im exited for a hugely ambitious two part epic genre flick to be on my dvd shelves, hopefully in even longer cuts, or even cut together as one monster four + hour film. I love thsi film, despite my many reservations.", "loved it, thinking it would fall flat of keeping me interested but every scene is more wtf than the last", "IT was everything that advertising said it\\'d be. Not as much \"horror\" as I would have liked, but very thrilling. Pennywise was performed well by Skaarsgard. But the best part by far was the hilarious dialog between the kids. Very well written comedic moments and a nice portrayal of the essence of the late 1980\\'s. Worth seeing it in theatres.", "Scary fun!!! Film review \"IT\" Firstly I\\'m the type of person that is very hard for a movie to actually scare me.  Even the original \"It\", I watched it when I was 18 and it did not scare me at all. But This reboot beat it\\'s predecessor by a mile. It was Creepy funny and perfect with Amazing Balance a great mix of comedy and horror.  reminded me a lot of \"STRANGER THINGS\" I mean the same vibes. My heart was racing most of the movie and there were some very good \"jump scare\" moments. There were a lot of humorous moments also throughout the movie so I was able to laugh off the fear a little bit. phenomenal acting from the kids that had real chemistry and of course, Bill Skarsgard, as Pennywise. It knows when to be funny and scary to drive the fear into us and to make us laugh. Great soundtrack, great editing,stunning cinematography with seamless camera movements,and absolutely a really impressive directing debut from Andy Muscueti he\\'s a very talented and top notch casting director, I can\\'t wait for his upcoming projects. Just A minor flaws for me in this movie..like some predictable parts and jump scares,Pennywise had too much CGI and the ending. It does not compare to the end of the first part of the miniseries and just provides an awkward scene between the kids (I just don\\'t want to go into details because of spoilers) Overall It\\'s Not just a great horror movie, but also a great movie itself.

And there is a spoiler, at the end, I am tempted to reveal , but wont.", "Growing up as a kid, I was a horror movie fanatic. I loved the feeling of clinging to the armrest of my chair as I stared in awe struck terror at the tv screen while some cheesy 80's scary movie played before me. So when the remake of It came out, you best believe that I stood in that line, excited like a kid in a candy store. And let me tell you, I left the theater with that exact same excitement, already planning my tickets for the sequel.  The movie was absolutely phenomenal. The producers took the original and made it a thousand times better, and I'm not only talking about the graphics. The CGI for this movie went above and beyond my expectations. The makers of this film took advantage of today's technology and brought the clown, Pennywise, to life as it made it feel as if you were experiencing the same thing as the Losers Club. You felt the same fears that terrorized those kids twist around in your chest. From the jump scares to psychological games, I give the fear factor a solid 10.   Let's not forget the good quality of makeup. Pennywise was no longer portrayed as this cheesy carnival clown. His costume and makeup was something straight out your worst nightmare. The other character's costumes were onpoint with the movie as well. They did a good job in sticking to the timeline of the movie and made sure that the Losers Club dressed in the perfect 80's attire. It was that small detail that made the storyline excellent too. The director didn't forget a thing in this remake. He made sure the audience was thoroughly engaged with every scene. He succeeded this by bringing out the the genuine quirkiness of pre-teen boys.  In order for the director to make the storyline stand out, he did make the length of this film a bit longer than I cared for. The director made sure he didn't miss one detail, but it was that excessiveness that made the length a bit unbearable, especially in those comfy reclining theater seats. That's the one downfall I find from this movie, however I still would give this movie a 4 1/2 star rating. I wouldn't mind seeing this movie a couple more times.

The acting has to be one of the best points for me, considering it's kids for the majority of the film. Finn Wolfhard adds to his amazing resume, he had the whole theatre in stitches throughout.   The first iteration of IT on the big screen was disappointing at best, it wasn't terrible, but it had so much potential, the remake utilises that potential, making a gripping and creepy story come to life.

Bill Skarsgard is really terrifying as Pennywise. Really, really creepy.   The best thing about the movie is the cast. I mean, this cast of kids is unbelievable. They all work so dang well together, you can buy how close the characters are because of that. And they are HILARIOUS. Seriously, hilarious. I love that in a horror film.

We wanted more Skarsgard dialogue.", "8.8/10 (Space for an over-saturated \"It\" pun). Advantages of recent critically-acclaimed horror movies usually are a reliance on the atmosphere rather than jumpscares and a well-thought out concept. Surprisingly, the main advantage of this particular horror movie is the plentiful amount of other genres, ranging from a Lovecraftian adventure to a teenage drama. I certainly don\\'t mean it won\\'t make you check your closet late at night, shivering in cold sweat, but that if it didn\\'t, it would still be a serviceable experience. I have yet to read the book,that Mr.King allegedly wrote heavy on crack,so i won\\'t be able to compare the gory details of both.Instead i\\'ll brag on some more about my feelings towards the cinematic counterpart. The Losers\\' Club surprised me undeniably. And with what you ask? Hollywood has a past with struggling to find decent child actors, so imagine my reaction when all of them are acted to the point of perfection. The adults in the movie seem like directly written by the \"King of Horror\" himself , as any traits of reasonability get thrown out of the window. Tim Curry is considered an iconic take on Pennywise by a major amount of people. Beg to differ,i considered him too silly and unintentionally comical to make your blood run cold. As for the new Pennywise, well he freaking rocks. Skarsgard succeeds in being both frightening and delightfully zany, without letting you feel any other way than disturbed when he is on screen. Even this movie has its occasional silliness, which (when is played the right way) I don\\'t mind. The one thing that bothers me is the pacing. It\\'s not too slow or too fast, but kind of formulaic. Every kid has to have his own encounter with the entity and it feels like the director is checking boxes. The boy with the glasses met the clown - CHECK, The girl met the clown - CHECK and so on. This is not necessarily bad, but the movie just keeps going with these scenes, one after another, without giving the viewer room to breathe. And the day after they get scared shitless after the first date with The Dancing Clown, each of the kids acts like he doesn\\'t remember it happening. Does Pennywise visit them on a set routine and they are kind of used to it? Or into it? Who the hell knows? The individual jumpscare scenes are superb, but they fail with meshing them well together. Thankfully, this goes on only for the introductory chapter and after that the movie gets the right to shine. What I really appreciated is the way the Losers communicated. When I was their age, I swore like a sailor in the company of my scurvy shipmates, so I am amused that kids in a big Hollywood movie finally talk realistically.  Conclusion: The new Stephen King adaptation hits almost all the right marks, with a \"Stranger Things tone and \"Stand by me\" themes. All the kids have their moments to shine, Pennywise has a magnetic screen presence and the cinematography is stunning. The first act felt formulaic, but as the film continues it makes up for it. \"It\" is a bloody good time at the movies that guarantees a lot of fun. Damn, I slipped.", "Great movie compared to the original this was outstanding it had just enough of plot and just enough of scare. I actually got a bit scared in this one unlike the original.

It has some fine performances, but the characters are so incredibly boring and the film is uninspired in execution and with a particularly odd choice of being restrained.

It's 1970 (why? because of the Manson Murders and Rosemary's Baby, duh), and a young couple are expecting their first child, so of course hubby buys wifey the ugliest and most disturbing doll in the world, as you do.

I have been watching horror movies for a very long time and I rarely get scared anymore. But this movie successfully scared me, many times. It even left me terrified on my way home.

Avatar is completely unoriginal, but that didn't seem to stop people from loving it. I truly don't understand how anyone who is a fan of horror could dislike this movie.", "With both of the Conjuring films being modern horror favorites of mine this spin-off of those two films is a massive disappointment as it lacks pretty much everything that made those two films so memorable and far better than the competition. Firstly the good parts are that the production is solid, it has some nice camerawork, a few creepy scenes and Annabelle Wallis is a decent lead however there are zero scares, it is mostly tension free, it is utterly predictable, the script is lacking, it is cliche ridden and there are no inventive scenes.", "Not worthy of the Conjurverse. Some cheap jump out scares and phoned in performances hurt this sidequel. Only worth seeing if you need to see them all or if you're seeing the far superior prequel Annabelle: Creation. That leads literally, directly into this one.", "Pretty typical modern horror film. This movie is sure to entertain anyone who liked The Conjuring, or anyone who enjoys cheesy horror flicks or creepy doll movies in general. However, in terms of substance, this movie is nothing horror fans have not already seen. The scares fit the stereotype of most modern horror movies in the 21st century--that is: jump scares. And while the jump scares do get somewhat tiresome, some of them may send a shiver or two down your spine thanks the movie's occasional success in achieving spaces that are dark, claustrophobic, and quite creepy. Still, though, it is because this movie has little to offer other than jump scares that it is not as memorable as The Conjuring which focused more on scaring the audience through its bleak, unnerving atmosphere and well-crafted storyline. The most frightening element of this loose prequel to The Conjuring is that the Annabelle doll is real (a Raggedy Ann doll now in the possession of the Warrens). Otherwise, the movie really doesn't have anything to offer. It's fun to go see or rent once, but that's about it.", "No plot. Decently scary.", "Silly, disappointing entry in the \"Conjuring\" franchise.", "A painfully boring and uninspired October-released weekend spookshow. Besides making a quick extra profit off of the success of 'The Conjuring', it has no other interest or purpose. The cast all do their very best with what they have to work with, but there is not a single scare to be had. What starts off promising, with an interesting incorporation of horrific real-life events, eventually delves into ghost story cliches and cheap jump scares.

Conjuring 2: more story a little less scary than the original. Conjuring: a little less story but the scariest than 2. Annabelle: Less story than conjuring 1-2 but still scary.

Very, very bad acting, easy-to-guess surprises and some laughable plot conveniences (not to mention the fact it's a horror film that isn't scary in the slightest), make this a truly poor attempt by a director with an ever-increasing catalogue of poor films.", "Annabelle is not without its moments and does a moderate job of explaining a classic icon of The Conjuring, but it sacrifices new ideas and originality to become more dull and lifeless than the doll itself.", "Although The Conjuring had a great sequel to follow it, the premise itself seemed like lightning in a bottle, but like any successful film these days, spinoffs and sequels are inevitable, due to the fact that studios are just money-hungry conglomerates. When Annabelle was released back in 2014, it only furthered this notion. While I've definitely seen worse horror films, this is a failure of a movie on multiple levels. There were so many interesting aspects about The Conjuring, giving depth in its story and detail in ts characters, but basing an entire film around a doll that appears for only a moment seemed like a waste of time to me, and it definitely was. With age, this film just becomes more and more forgettable, but with the release of Annabelle: Creation coming up, let's revisit the movie that was completely unnecessary.   The biggest problem that people will find with this film, is that it truly feels like an excuse to continue the lore of The Conjuring franchise. Not very long, not very complex, and quite frankly not that scary, Annabelle is about as bland as horror films can get these days. A family moves into a new house, has a baby, and begins to get haunted by a demon, who is communicating through the doll. Without any large reveals to keep you interested or a strong enough conclusion leave you somewhat satisfied, this premise does absolutely nothing to earn praise from anyone.   The biggest takeaway that I was able to find here, was the fact that the main cast in Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton seemed to be quite devoted to their respective roles as husband and wife. Quite honestly, this isa film that could've easily placed anyone in these roles, so I found myself appreciating their dedication in pulling the audience into the lives of these everyday characters. Their performances aren't award-worthy or anything of that nature, but by the end of the film, the biggest positive was the cast, at least in my opinion. That being said, the rest of the film just feels like a bleak movie, filled with cop-outs and wasted opportunities.  Like most generic horror films, Annabelle is riddled with quite a few false-scares, but it's not like the film earns anything from it by having an awesome finale, because the film really just ends, without having anything remotely exciting happen. Throughout the film, there are many close-ups on sewing machines and dolls, making you think that something is about to jump out and scare you, but then it just cuts to the next scene. As I said, this is never earned throughout the film, because this tactic is consistently used, becoming more annoying than terrifying. I found myself bored throughout the majority of the movie, even when it was trying to be scary.  In the end, Annabelle is a film that should've had a completely different team working on it. I felt as though this crew and post-production team should've taken on a strict drama, because that's what I felt like I was watching most of the time. With more engaging direction, a different editing style, and a script that left many more intriguing questions than this final result did, Annabelle just feels like a completely missed opportunity for horror fans or fans of The Conjuring in general. It's an easy watch for those who are easily scared, but that's also a negative, so I can't muster up anything remotely positive about this film, other than there are are very nice shots and the actors seem to be giving it their all. Overall, this is a movie that just shouldn't have been made. Let's see what Annabelle: Creation has to offer.", "I never expected Annabelle to live up to the high standards of The Conjuring, but all I was hoping for was a decent horror movie. Basic story: demon wants a soul. I'm not a fan of seeing the physical form of demons because they can look so cheesy and ridiculous that it's more laughable than scary. Sometimes less is more.

Like the aforementioned The Conjuring, it takes clear inspiration from the horror films of old - this time around, the more psychological horror films of the late 70s rather than the haunted house films The Conjuring. The glimmers of promise aren't very prominent, unfortunately. There are exactly three scenes of somewhat intense scares in this film: a genuinely creepy scene involving an elevator/stairs chase, a scene with a record player, and a culminating scene in the climax that does an admittedly clever trick for half a minute. The rest is a painfully boring slog through a completely bland and by-the-numbers horror screenplay delivered by wooden performances across the board (although Annabelle Wallis seems to be trying really hard). Director John R. Leonetti's ties to the franchise (he served as DP on The Conjuring) don't manage to do the film any favors in boosting its quality, unfortunately: this is a film that could use the touch of a James Wan, not the director of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and The Butterfly Effect 2.", "one of the best horror movies in recent years! great creepy story full of good jump scares. really feel for the character especially alfre woodard(sp?). if you are looking for a horror that wont disappoint i highly recommend this one!", "This was okay.

Leonetti Review O sweet a creepy doll movie, that's a prequel to the conjuring one of my favorite horror films, I mean what could go wrong. Holy crap was this the most disappointing horror movie I've seen since the nightmare on elm street remake and seed of Chucky. This film revolves around a woman who is being haunted by the evil spirit of a woman named Annabelle that has possessed her doll and wishes to take her newborns soul. It opens with the same opening as the conjuring and you can hear ED Warrens voice talking to a victim of the dolls evil deeds. The film then cuts to what supposedly happened before those events occurred before but I felt like their a lot of unanswered questions like how did they end up with the doll, the woman played terribly by Annabelle Wallis says it disappeared at the end so she could not have been the one to lock it up and leave it for her daughter. The father named John who is portrayed even more terribly by Ward Horton doesn't serve diddly crap, he's just there can't act and I don't like him. The one plays the pries however I actually liked him, I don't know I guess I have weakness for priests in this kinds of movies. The visuals are kind of cool, I mean there the best things about this movie, which can me kind of suspect that the director is only good with visuals and not storytelling cause the story just left me with questions that I would suspect answered in this movie. The one cool thing is when you see the doll movie cause man that is one ugly creepy looking doll. The ending piste me off a bit cause it felt like the first three chucky movies but only with a baby and the doll not even almost succeeding or at least I don't think it was close to succeeding. Annabelle is a film that I saw no trailers or commercials for cause I had high hopes but those hopes went down the drain but had some nice visuals so I'm giving Annabelle a two out of five.", "If I could make a zero, I would. Annabelle is the most disappointing film in ages. The fact that this rubbish film, ridden with cliches, holes, and complete lack of fundamentals is getting a sequel is a travesty.  It only made money by piggy backing off James Wan's name (people assumed he directed it. I wish he had) and the Conjuring. I feel for it myself, as I adore the Conjuring, and the Annabelle story seemed like a sure fire win.   Unfortunately it not only shot blanks, but backfired in the process, causing injury on top of insult.  If you're one of the lucky that didn't waste precious time or money on this garbage, STAY AWAY!   Pure Trash and failure.", "Distinctly average horror fare... The doll is ugly &amp; creepy.

That scene was good, but the majority of the movie was poor. Story, character development, acting, dialogue, scare factors, originality all were poor. No better quality than your average TV show.

While \\'Annabelle\\' tries to live up to the quality of \\'Conjuring,\\' it falls severely short for a number of reasons.

Since it seems like these senseless, and meaningless horror movies will continue to get made for the rest of our lives, we might as well take it as an opportunity to learn how not to make a quality horror film.  \"Annabelle\" although showed glimmers of potential, it is full of dull scares and emotionless acting, and is accompanied by an absurd and boring storyline.  I strongly recommend to anyone who considers watching this movie not too. There\\'s so much more you could do with your life, and there are plenty of quality horror movies out there. Go watch \"Goodnight Mommy\", \"The Babadook\", \"Sinister\", \"It Follows\", or \"The Conjuring\". All of these movies are much better than Annabelle, and in fact, pretty much any movie is better than this one.  Here, we follow the story of a doll named Annabelle, who is used as a tangible object for a demon to attach onto, so that it may pursue the souls of its victims. We saw our first glimpse of Annabelle in the film \"The Conjuring\", which I certainly loved. Despite the plot being ridiculous already, this movie does nothing to make it better.   There was literally nothing scary in this movie, and although there were a few ideas that had potential, none of them resulted the way they should\\'ve. There are plenty of fake scares and cheesy moments in this film that are accompanied by loud, jarring sounds. It really takes away the intensity of the moment, and there was not one moment where I was hiding behind my blanket in fear.   Although the actors in this film would work as very minor roles in any other film, neither of our main characters manage to put on a good performance. Neither of them were able to relay any true emotion, and it never felt like they were actually scared of the situation. It looked like they were two crappy actors that were getting paid for starring in a garbage movie, and although I hate saying that people are bad at their passion, it was just too noticeable in this case.   The thing about having a doll as your antagonist is that it just isn\\'t scary. If this was happening in real life, I would either A.) Punt the sh** out of that doll. B.) Get a knife and cut it into little bits and pieces, or C.) Never pass it on in the first place. I mean, lets be real, no one in their right mind would intentionally pass this doll onto others based on its look, because it looks horrifying and ugly. It\\'s just ridiculous in every way, and at no moment was I invested into the plot.  I will never forget the first time I saw this trailer, and it was in theaters. That moment when the husband gave his wife the doll and she responded with \"it fits right in\", everyone in the theater groaned out of agony. They knew just as much as I did that this was stupid, and the reasons behind the movie were just downright awful.   The only thing I even remotely liked about this movie was a scene early on where the couple is getting attacked by a cult group of maniacs. It was semi intense and unsettling just a tad, but other than that, nothing else in this movie was really impressive.  In the end, I found little joy in this movie. Being the huge horror fan that I am, I\\'m pretty open to most horror films, but this was one of the worst horror films I\\'ve seen in my life. In the end, if it weren\\'t for the glimmers of potential or the exciting first scene, I would\\'ve given this movie half a star, but instead of full on exorcising this film, I\\'m just going to kill it and say this movie deserves a star.", "Annabelle is worse than the conjuring!

On the one hand, you have a movie like Annabelle. There is nothing in Annabelle that we haven't seen in countless horror movies that have come before it. The scares are the same, the characters are the same, the story is the same. It's not a great movie.   On the other hand, you have The Judge. The Judge is likewise filled with characters, situations and resolutions we've seen many times before. The courtroom stuff has been done, the father-son dynamic has been done, the self discovery, or rediscovery, has been done. The Judge is a really great movie.   So what's the difference? Why does The Judge get a free pass on its redundancy, while Annabelle gets walloped for it?  Because in Annabelle's case, it's not just that it's been done before, but that it's been done better, much better. Annabelle has cheesy writing, subpar acting, cheap scares you can see coming a mile away and a sacrificial resolution no demon possession movie would be complete without.   The Judge, on the other hand, is superbly well made. The acting is top notch: Robert Downey, Jr. is finally out from under the metal suit and back in the real world. He's an interesting actor in that he's really not that versatile. Even in this film, which bears no resemblance whatsoever to any of his superhero movies, I kept seeing his character as a not as rich or brilliant Tony Stark without the costume. Robert Downey, Jr. is just Robert Downey, Jr. That smarmy, sarcastic, showboaty wit of his goes with him from role to role.  But it works here and he has a great chemistry with Robert Duvall.  Robert Duvall is an absolute cinematic treasure. He's one of the most talented, accomplished, illuminating actors alive. He's starred in a dozen of the greatest films ever made. And what he brings to this very complicated, very layered role will without a doubt bag him a bevy of nominations and possibly trophies come awards season.   Annabelle features no A-list, or even recognizable acting talent. Which can sometimes work in a horror movies favour. Not here though.   Another thing about The Judge that stands out is in the writing. This is probably one of the best written scripts in a long time. I heard an interview with Duvall the other day and they were talking about how, despite the film having Downey, Jr. and Duvall, who are both big improvisers, there was very little improvising in this film because the best stuff was already on the page. This is a smart script filled with good dialogue, a nice balance of humour and drama, a great deal of empathy for its characters and a knowing confidence not only in courtroom politics but in family dynamics. I expect great things from Nick Scheck, who only has one other feature film script credit to his name (the great 2008 Clint Eastwood drama Gran Torino).  Director David Dobkin, trying his hand at drama after a string of silly comedies, gives the film a very polished look. He isn't a showy director but, aside from some overexposed light flooding in from the courtroom windows, which looks cool, he doesn't need to be. These films work best when you use the camera to simply observe rather than wrangle.   This movie will hit a little closer to home if you can relate to the characters and the things they're going through. Other people may be put off by the way the film seems intent on wrenching a few drops of emotion overflow from your sockets. It can feel slightly manipulative in that way, but it does it so well, you don't really mind being manipulated. Kind of like politics.  It's also a fine testament to the movie that at two and a half hours, it doesn't feel overlong. That's not easy to do in a film that doesn't feature a single explosion or hero of the day gunfight.

Leonetti (Mortal Kombat: Annihilation) Written By Gary Dauberman Starring: Annabelle Wallis, Alfre Woodard, Ward Horton, Tony Amendola, Brian Howe, Kerry O\\'Malley, Ivar Brogger, Eric Laden, Gabriel Bateman and Shiloh Nelson.  Really Hollywood, \"Annabelle\" is supposed to be scary? It is the dullest movie ever to feature a creepy doll. It is a spin-off and a prequel to \"The Conjuring\" which grossed $320 million worldwide and became a huge hit for director James Wan. Even though I gave a mixed review to \"The Conjuring\", it was one of the best looking horror movies of this decade. The man who shot \"The Conjuring\", John R. Leonetti made \"Annabelle\" and the result is a sleazy horror film that brings nothing new to this genre.  \"Annabelle\" also features the most boring couple I have ever seen in a movie. The movie begins in 1969 where we meet John and Mia Form (Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton), they live in Santa Monica and they are expecting their first child. John soon gives her a present, it\\'s the doll that she\\'s always wanted, the creepy doll that will soon terrorize their lives. Soon, their neighbors get murdered by a satanic cult and they go after John and Mia as well. The assailants are soon killed by the police but one of them, Annabelle Higgins was holding the doll while she was dying. Why is that important? A drop of her blood causes the doll to be possessed by a demon.  Then we get your typical horror movie cliches, the elderly priest who tries to stop the evil spirit, the cat jumping out of the closet, the creaky door sounds, the white-robed figures who are always not scary, and the elderly black woman who has been through this ordeal before. The elderly woman is played by Alfre Woodard and honestly, she hasn\\'t aged in twenty years. Alfre, You are not a grandma, you\\'re still old enough to have sex with a thirty-year old man.   \"The Conjuring\" breathed new life into the scary movie genre, \"Annabelle\" just sucks out all of the freshness from that movie as well as 100 minutes of your life. The acting is not good, the story is predictable and the pig-tailed doll (who made a small appearance in \"The Conjuring\") is not scary. \"Annabelle\" is a cheap horror movie that only relies on jump scares, horror movie cliches and the \"Before The Conjuring There Was\" tagline just to make a huge profit at the box office.", "Annabelle might be just a conglomeration of other, better horror titles such as Insidious, the Conjuring, Rosemary's Baby, etc., but that means that it still steals from the very best, resulting in a decent flick.

Honestly, I found it not worthy of a relation to the Conjuring.", "Arguably a better film than the original to which this is sort of a prequel, however it's probably unfair to judge to two together as there only tenuously related. This can get quite creepy in places and the well done 1970's period setting adds to the atmosphere.

Creepy stuff.", "Really disappointing. The trailer is infinitely better than the actual film. Fleeting moments of actual scary footage, but these are limited to the more realistic aspects of the story. Overall, a letdown.", "Booooooring. The Conjuring was better.", "The story wasn't very original and the end was pure crap. This movie makes me sad. The first 20 minutes was really good, though. It had a glimmer of potential!", "its alright I own it", "Not as good as the Conjuring but neat back story", "This movie was not scary in my opinion nor creepy.", "I loved The Conjuring, I was very disappointed with this prequel. Not even a mention of Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren or any ties to the real Annabelle story.", "Honestly I would give this negative stars if I could. You will never get the time back from watching this terrible movie, so save yourself the regret..", "Annabelle is decent but very dull, dry, and boring. The story of this film is very slow and boring and the acting is very horrible. The actors put no emotion into their characters. The film is also predictable at time and some of the scares in the film don't work. But there are some stuff to like about this film. Now there are some scares that do work but some of the other scares in the film just don't work and they get way too clich\u0436d and predictable. There is one scene that takes place in the basement and it actually did scare me. Also the doll in this film is creepy but it really doesn't do anything it just sits there and stares at you. Which is creepy but at least make the doll do something like turn its head or at least jump on someone and attack them. Or even walk across the room. There's a demon in this film also and it's really cool looking but it's hardly in the film. The film is slow in the beginning but it kind of starts to pick up when the basement scene starts. Also the characters in the film make some of the most stupidest decisions I have ever seen. John R. Leonetti has good direction in the film it's at least better than the films he directed previously. This film has potential to be at least a good movie but the writing and acting is what held this movie back. This movie just felt like a cash grab because it relates to The Conjuring.

What was really good about The Conjuring is really generic and forgettable in Annabelle. The Conjuring had a great story, genuine scares, great environment, and most of all great characters that you actually felt for when all the chaos went down in that movie. Annabelle squanders it's potential with dull and wooden as hell characters that weren't interesting at all, predictable scares, unoriginal story, and stupid script with dumb situations along with poorly written dialogue. A lot of the horror has to do with the Annabelle doll and there were a lot of times where shots would just linger right on it and some of them were just pointless and made the movie's pacing even more slower. Speaking of pacing, this film had a lot of moments where I was just bored because there were just scenes of people doing nothing and they didn't do anything to enhance the plot or make the movie anymore interesting. Alfre Woodard's character was literally pointless and she served no purpose to the story that was being told and her character was only added in to add unnecessary drama that ended up going nowhere. The only positives I could name off of the film are that there were some scenes that managed to be creepy and suspenseful and the cinematography was good. In the end, this film is not worth recommending to anybody and I would tell people to watch The Conjuring or The Babadook instead because those films are actually well made and are actually scary enough to be memorable.", "Boring and not that scary.

Because there were no big name stars in it? Because its cliche? The camera angles were cool and the scares were spot on. I just feel like the more they drag on a franchise, the more prone it is to receive bad hype, not because its a bad movie, but because PEOPLE WANT IT TO FAIL.

While at times being silly and having a somewhat anticlimactic ending, Annabelle still proved to be far scarier and more investing than I expected it to be.

However, I find this movie a  REAL disappointment. The first couple of scenes, it was exciting for me!  It got even more scarier as the scenes go through. Throughout the rest of the movie was really boring. I thought that the movie was focusing more on the doll  but it ended up with the reaction and behavior of the main character who plays  the mom. The most exciting part was when the camera zoomed into the doll, I thought something will happen. NOT. All the feelings of suspense was a waste  for that moment.  For the title: If you want to call this movie Annabelle, shouldn't the movie be focused MORE on the DOLL only???  I also wished this movie was way longer like about 2 hours. I'm glad I didn't watch this in theaters otherwise it will be a waste of my money. Again.. make this movie longer!!!!!

The atmosphere is decent here. The problem is that it\\'s just plain lazy. While \"The Conjuring\" borrowed from other horror films and turned the tropes upside down to revive the definitive scare factor in haunted house movies, \"Annabelle\" just borrows the clich\u00e9s and wallows in them. It never lives up to its intriguing source material and is content to stand in mediocrity. The Annabelle doll is truly terrifying in \"The Conjuring\" and serves as one of the eeriest cases Ed and Lorraine Warren took on, and naturally, when you follow up something like \"The Conjuring\" with a cool idea for a spinoff, you don\\'t expect disappointment. The acting in \"Annabelle\" is bland, the writing is been there-done that territory, and there\\'s not an ounce of tension. Overall, fans of \"The Conjuring\" are far better off sticking with that modern classic than experiencing this lazy horror spinoff.", "I think it\\'s save to say the horror genre is officially dead. Yup, it was dying, but ANNABELLE delivered the final bullet to the head. Now I\\'ll start off by saying that I don\\'t really find the Annabelle doll creepy at all. I didn\\'t think she was all that scary in \"The Conjuring\" so I\\'m sure as he\\'ll not going to think she\\'s scary in an entire movie. It just looks like they\\'re trying WAY too hard to make her creepy. The real Annabelle doll was a normal Ragety Anne, which would have been ten times creepier.  Basically Annabelle looks like something you\\'d see in a movie, but now onto the film. Slow, boring, badly acted, predictable, cash grab. Those are just a few of the things that describe ANNABELLE. This is one of those films that tries to create slow build up with its story, and I give it credit for that, but that only works if your plot and characters are interesting, and considering ANNABELLE\\'S plot is more predictable than a dystopian YA novel and it\\'s characters so one dimensional I wouldn\\'t even classify them as stereotypes, the movie just ends up being absolutely boring", "As a period piece it works, as a horror film it fails. Something's wrong with that.", "This was better than I expected but then you're always onto a winner with creepy dolls and babies, both of which have always been scary. It's a spinoff from The Conjuring which was a superb horror but this doesn't quite match the brilliance of that one. There is a lot lifted from other films of the same genre but it still provides some decent scares, none of which I'll mention here as that would ruin the scares for others.

Mia &amp; John have neighbors Pete &amp; Sharon Higgins whose daughter Annabelle ran off with a cult about 2 years ago. John &amp; Mia prepare the baby\\'s room for their child, and John presents Mia with a gift for the baby. A giant porcelain doll. Evening falls and Mia hears a scream next door, when John investigates, they find their neighbors dead. Mia is attacked at home by a Annabelle Higgins &amp; her boyfriend. John comes to rescue Mia, but is also hurt. Cops show up and kill the boyfriend while Annabelle kills herself. The blood from Annabelle Higgins enters the doll. It turns out that Annabelle Higgins was part of a satanic cult trying to raise a demon. Mia &amp; John move to Pasadena after John put the doll in the trash. The dolls follows them to Pasadena as paranormal events begin to haunt Mia and her baby in their new home. \"Annabelle\" was not as scary as most movies in it\\'s genre but it gives a good prequel to the \"Conjuring\" and the origin of the evil.", "so stupid hahahahaha", "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. That's all well and good, but when a director not only (painfully and misguidedly) copies another director's style, while stealing from quite a few better films, then we have ourselves a problem. Annabelle sheds light on the possessed doll and where she came from. Did this even warrant a full film? After sitting through this, I can easily say it didn't. The back story for the doll is not only robbed from a much better, and iconic, horror film, but it just reeks of laziness. The film seems to pander around for an hour or so, never really sure what to do or where to go. That's the biggest problem with this film: It even feels as if it has no purpose. We saw the doll in The Conjuring, where we were given some enticing tidbits. And that's what it should have stayed at. A feature film for the doll only tarnishes the original. Speaking of tarnishing, director John R. Leonetti attempts to recreate James Wan's directing style from the first, but he fails miserably. It becomes apparent very early on that he is overdoing it, without even trying to do anything of his own. And then there's the acting. They work with what they're given, which can be boiled down to three categories: The skeptic, The Victim, and The Believer. All three play their parts to the best of their ability, but they are unable to transcend their stereotypical characters. By the time it ends, and it does so on such a nonsensical and abrupt note, the viewer is left waiting patiently for The Conjuring 2, and rapidly clearing their mind of this mess of a film.", "Destined to be a spin off from the scary and very effective 'The Conjuring', Annabelle arrives.

Anyway, I can\\'t say I liked it either, and although I saw it coming, because of how much I liked \"The Conjuring\" I couldn\\'t help feeling disappointed. And is that while watching the film (and also recalling its predecessor) you realize it has potential, but a pacing that is too slow and boring, a pair of protagonists pretty weak (especially Ward Horton, VERY weak in his case) as two uninteresting characters in a story full of ineffective scares and virtually no tension, don\\'t let me give \"Annabelle\" a higher rating.

The acting was decent, I liked the performances of Annabelle Wallis and Alfre Woodard. The soundtrack was also pretty intense at times. For a movie titled 'Annabelle' you would expect that it would almost entirely focus on the doll itself, but that was definitely not the case here.

Therefore, I do not favor this movie, because of all the similar paranormal parts that have been in other movies. Such as the slamming doors, the flickering lights, moving objects, music playing without being turned on, etc. Also in almost every paranormal movie, a priest gets involved.

Annabelle is its own spinoff from the doll in 2013 The Conjuring film which was a fun horror film. The worse thing is Annabelle fails to live up too it as a spin off. It is disappointing, as Annabelle is a supernatural object that is haunted and possessed that puts everyone in close proximities in danger. What else can you expect in a supernatural horror that follows the clich\u00e9s, such as a happily married couple try to start a new life and a baby soon to be expected. The husband surprises wife with a creepy looking doll, he has an over night job, leaving her alone experiencing all kinds of unexpected noise. The routine is clearly checked off for the typical horror movie. The sad thing is the movie surprises with a lot of cheap scares, like objects being turned on or watching an intense scene of the lady using the sewing machine intently. Then, an unexpected fire breaks out in kitchen. The movie does try to raise all bars of trying to bring any scares during the climax when a possessive demonic figure chases the main character through dark lighted corridors or a flashy scene in the stairwell. The movie fails to be scary in every way; it does have that creepy premise but nothing else.   Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton also gave stale performances as the two leads playing Mia and John Form. One unique thing that Annabelle actually had that was an entertaining reference in the movie is classic Rosemary Baby film. A couple expecting a baby, living in a condo and a plot that has some form of cult that is haunting Mia when she is alone.

On one hand they tried a few different things that I respect, and throughout the film there was, on very sparse occasion, a good moment (Spoilers ahead): For instance the Book store owner? I thuroughly enjoyed the fact she wasn't evil, as that was the trope I was assuming they were going for (in a twist we would all realise the old wise crone is surprisingly a minion of satan! Gasp!) but instead she saves the day, so that was cool. Unfortunately they fell prey to basically every other cliche even when it made absolutely no sense. A la: She's running up the stairs, and then theres lightning? in the building? in the stairwell? Really? And why would any self respecting demon mess with the family before just, yaknow, trying to make the deal? this movie could've been 5 minutes long, little was achieved by making it this long, and on that note, the first act of the film could stand alone as its own film and no one would bat an eye.  Seeing as I've focused on the plot, I'm going to now focus on the actual construction of the film, as I feel that also really pulls the audience out of any chance of being frightened at all. It felt like the director couldn't decide between using a steadycam or a handheld, half the scenes feel like a well produced movie, the other half feel like paranormal activity/blairwitch/found footage. While I'm okay with either technique, combining both of them is confusing and distracting.  Then again, take everything I said with a grain of salt.

Unfortunately, this movie doesn't hit the storytelling, quality or scares like The Conjuring did. Set many years before the events of the Conjuring Annabelle is about a family: John (Ward Horton) and Mia Gordon (Annabelle Wallis). John and Mia are expecting their first child and have moved into a new neighborhood. One day John picks up a doll that Mia has been searching for a long time to complete her collection. All seems well until one night Mia awakens to hear screaming from the next door neighbor. All of a sudden they are attacked by a Satanic Cult (yup this really happens). The two cultists are killed, but one of them transfers her soul into the doll John bought. Strange things start to happen to Mia when John is away at work. Doors close, bumps are heard and the doll suddenly appears in places that it wasn't left at. While this whole premise is creepy the film just isn't that creepy. It borrows a lot of scares I would say from a similar film Insidious (2010). The film is pretty low budget and you can tell this not having the most top notch actors...the acting kinda sucks especially the husbands...ugh.

'Before the Conjuring, there was ANNABELLE'. Gee, thanks guys! You know your film is lackluster when a LIFETIME ORIGINAL TV MOVIE is better than this. Yes, I thought Big Driver was a considerably better film. Perhaps considerably is a strong word, as I wouldn't call Big Driver a good film, but for what it was going for, and the audience it wanted to attain, it did a good job at giving the people what they wanted to see. This one, on the other hand, whoo boy, this was a rough movie to sit through. It gets two stars because the film is certainly watchable enough, Alfre Woodward is excellent here, and it has some decent scares. But this just seems to borrow heavily from other films like The Conjuring itself, Insidious, Paranormal Activity, Rosemary's Baby, among others. As you can see, the films that I've mentioned here all have one thing in common, and that is that they are all better than Annabelle. I don't think the film has one original bone in its body. Of course, not that every horror film needs to be original in order to be good. But the difference is that in those films I mentioned, that this 'borrows' from, there was at least a knowledge of how to execute real scares and how to build tension. It wasn't just cheap jump scares, like this movie does. Even worse, when shit starts hitting the fan and strange things happen around her house, the main actress, named ANNABELLE Wallis, just doesn't do a good job at selling it. Not that she's not a decent actress, but there's no sense of urgency or that she's truly terrified about what's happening to her. She may act like she's terrified, but I didn't buy it at all. That really dulls the impact of what you're trying to do. That's really the main reason I disliked this film, there's just no sense of urgency to what's happening here, no real danger. Even when Mia's baby is in danger, you never feel that anything wrong is REALLY gonna happen to them. And that's a big problem. Horror films should be about characters being put into situations they normally wouldn't be in, much as this film, but I don't know what it is about this movie, but it just doesn't pull it off well. Like there's no real reason any of this happening, it's just happening because they had to come up with a story for this spin-off film after The Conjuring was so successful and they wanted to make some money. Hell, they probably took some generic script that had nothing to do with The Conjuring and made some tweaks to the script so it could be sold as the spin-off. One or two decent scares and Alfre Woodward aren't gonna save you. And I really do mean one or two. This film is also incredibly slow paced, so you're gonna be sit there for a LOOOONG period of time before anything truly interesting happens. This was just a failure. Not necessarily on all levels, but it certainly failed on most of them. There's no reason to watch this when it borrows from so many other superior films, that you should watch instead of this.

It gives nods to The Conjuring, offers up some good performances , and a few incredibly good scares. While James Wan\\'s name is still attached to the project, the directoing by John R.

What separates it from The Conjuring , are things he likely doesn\\'t have the power to do, such as edit and cut away bits of script like Wan was able to do, (when working with the Hayes brothers, this should happen every time). It simply doesn\\'t have the same balance as The Conjuring. The scares occur at a rapid pace , and a few fall short because of that. The camera centers on the demonic doll a tad too much before we get to see her move and levitate. Nevertheless , Annabelle pushes Chucky out of the water.

Now we have Annabelle a prequel to it giving us the origin story of the possessed doll which was more of the side story in The Conjuring. So those who liked the first film will be excited about this one too. Unfortunately it falls short. I had very low expectations after seeing low ratings but it was pleasant surprise that it wasn\\'t as bad as I thought it would be.  The movie is a slow burner, so if the impatient ones might easily get bored with this. We have a standard couple Mia and John. Mia played by Annabelle Wallis (felt like intentionally cast for coincidence!!) and Ward Horton as John. Not so much great acting skills can be expected here, anyways they do a decent job for a horror film. Mia is pregnant and one day John gifts her a doll to add to her collection. No guesses which doll and we are all like \"no! what are you doing?! don\\'t keep that!!\", lol. Well actually the doll isn\\'t possessed yet, it was just another cute doll until one day a terrible incident occurs followed by more horrific encounters. Well that\\'s where I will stop, it has short run time of about 100 minutes and there not much of story. It is actually great that they didn\\'t drag it much.  Directed by John Leonetti who was cinematographer with James Wan for The Conjuring, there are many nice shots and couple of jump scares for those enjoy it. I also kind of liked they kept the pacing slow, which built up tension and suspense steadily and gradually. Well most of it is what we already scene in many horror flicks. But original horror films are so rare these years. Even with recycled material, the film worked for me as it looked technically sound for such a low budget film. It was good old school horror with not much CGI gore and stuff. The scene where Mia gets stuck in elevator in the basement was really scary and my favorite from the film. There are many more scares which I did not see coming and were quite unpredictable. The background score almost similar to The Conjuring again generates the scary tone required thus works effectively.  Overall, I had a good time even if it was just an average movie at best. The weak point was the script, which I wish was better written. Also director doesn\\'t try anything new and innovative for which there definitely potential. Still, Annabelle works just fine for horror genre as it does have enough amount tension getting built up plus scary moments making it worth a shot.  RATING: [2.5/5]", "Dolls are creepy, let's just put that out there, at least to me. If you've seen The Conjuring or happen to have a friend or family member who likes dolls then you'll know how weird they can be. The possessed doll idea has been done, and done well in the past and this latest offering from producer James Wann and Director John R Leonetti who both worked on The Conjuring and Insidious.    What sets out as a promising possession idea soon falls in to what Mark Kermode describes as 'quietly, quietly, quietly, quietly, BANG'. The main problem is the over familiarity and the creeping sense that you've seen and know this story already. If you've seen Insidious, its terrible sequel, Sinister or the ilk then you know when the overly done jump scares are coming, although notably most of the tension comes from the deliberate wide shots which leave the eye to flit round the frame looking for what may jump out at any second.    There are some very well paced parts that build the unease to heart-rate rising tension, but these are soon ruined by ridiculously rubbish looking demons or whatever it is that's supposed to be haunting them. The story is a bit of a mess, and despite the paint by numbers schlock, fails to keep the audience invested past the halfway mark as it rapidly attempts to ramp up the scares and wrap up by simply being louder and noisier (again ref Insidious etc.) Remarkably it's the doll itself that seems to have had the best acting classes as the remaining cast chew through the script without much conviction, with exception to Annabelle Wallis who despite her best concerned and frightened mother act, comes across as fairly annoying at times.    I was quite surprised to find that Leonetti was the cinematographer on Child's Play 3, a classic Chucky film, surely there's a few things that could have been learnt from this plastic counterpart's movie outings? There's worse you can do than to give it ago however, as the few golden moments of tension will have you questioning your/ your friends doll collection when you get home.", "Creepy but not scary , or even good.", "A horror movie that forgets it is supposed to be a horror movie for extended periods of time is hardly an effective cocktail.", "The much-awaited horror movie of 2014, Annabelle really proved how thrilling and scary movie it was. Its story was interesting that it really caught my attention especially it was a spin-off of a great horror movie from James Wan's The Conjuring. Though, Wan wasn't the director, he was the producer and I'm sure he supervised the production of the movie plus the music background was scored by Joseph Bishara, the same man behind Insidious and The Conjuring scary music background. It was cleverly made especially the story just like Insidious Chapter 2 which makes it a real good horror movie to be highly recommended. Contrary to other movie reviews, that is wasn't a scary movie at all, I beg to disagree. You can't deny how many times you have been jump on your seats because of its tension and scary moments! Remember the elevator scene? It was one of the scariest scenes I've watched on a horror movie! The presence of Annabelle herself without moving and with just her scary face on focus, it was terrifying enough for this horror movie. Good thing she didn't make any single move or even speak! It would have been corny already. The casts supported the big story of the movie by delivering notable acts especially Annabelle Wallis, Tony Amendola and Alfre Woodard. I like the idea where they truly made Annabelle as the only true source of the movie scare. Everytime she pops in the scene, I felt fear and tense. I just wish they explain further more about the doll but I guess its part of the mystery of the story. If you're a fan of James Wan movies, then this is highly recommended. It may not have the same level of terror and scares of Insidious and The Conjuring but as the tagline says, before The Conjuring, there was Annabelle.

This is a pretty typical ghost/demon movie with hauntings and possession, there's nothing you haven't seen before in this film and nothing about the plot or the characters are new. However, James Wan does have a knack for creating a tense, creepy atmosphere and the scares are quite well done when focussing on smaller, more insidious scares like creaking doors and eerie sounds. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson also give good performances as The Warrens and the film is certainly engaging and entertaining throughout. However, my biggest issue with this film is it's reliance on cheap jump scares, every few minutes there's a loud noise telling the audience to be scared rather than being genuinely scary and it gets old quickly, almost to the point of fatigue. Overall, although better than a lot of the dross in the horror movie genre, this movie is pretty forgettable and more likely to make you jump than actually scare you.", "I wish I could have invited Ed and Lorraine Warren over to some of the places I lived in the past.

I'm glad I finally took the time to watch it. The Conjuring adds a new element to the haunting genre, following the people investigating rather than the one haunting. Which helps build a rapport with the audience.   I really like the casting choice, they have an eerie quality about them, like this is something they'd actually do, being Paranormal investigators that is. A favorite part for me would have to be the Annabelle part, something about it related to me. I remember hearing a very similar urban legend when growing up, it really creeped me out back then. One of the reasons I came back to watch this film was the news of Annabelle: Creation actually being pretty decent. It's on the watch list just after the 2nd Conjuring.

Some very impressive camera work too and tributes to old horrors riddled all over it.", "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, we just got through watching The Conjuring. Which is an odd name since no one in the movie did any conjuring.  SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Let s conjure up a review, shall we?  GREG: Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston) move into an old farm home in the woods of Rhode Island. They have 5 adorable daughters who like to play hide and seek. Things are going fine when one day while playing hide and seek with her youngest, Carolyn meets up with a spook. After that things start to get really weird. Laughter comes from the hidden basement. The clocks all stop at 3:07 AM. The pictures in the hallway fall from the wall. Carolyn is freaked out and goes to a lecture at the local college where she enlists the help of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga), two self-proclaimed paranormal investigators.  SCOTT: Upon visiting the house, Lorraine, who has a special psychic connection to spirits, immediately senses a ghostly presence that has latched onto the entire family. Ed and Lorraine research the home s history and discover that the house once belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba who sacrificed her week-old infant, climbed to the top of a tree in the backyard, cursed all those who would take her land, professed her love for Satan, then committed suicide. The remainder of the movie consists of Ed and Lorraine s attempt to help the Perron family rid themselves of the curse and the demonic spirits inhabiting their home.  GREG: Scott, I compare all horror movies to The Exorcist, which is easily the scariest movie I have ever seen. The Conjuring was probably the least scary movie I have ever seen. Even last April s Scary Movie V was more frightening than this movie. The Conjuring plays out more like a documentary than a horror film. It follows the events surrounding the Perron s haunting step-by-step. And it introduces us to the Warrens by giving us a lot of backstory to prove to the audience that they were experts in their field. I think this movie would have done well to go that route: to present the facts as a documentary about a true event. That would have been far scarier.  SCOTT: On a 1 to 10 scale of scariness, I d give The Conjuring a 6. It wasn t close to being the most chilling movie I ve ever seen, but there were moments when I was definitely cringing and wincing. As scary movies go, The Conjuring was fairly effective in producing the usual false alarms and underwear-soiling gotcha moments. We ve seen movies like The Conjuring many times before. Poltergeist comes to mind as a classic in this genre. In every scary movie of this type, the family inhabiting the haunted house seems to perform an odd set of behaviors that accentuates their vulnerability. In The Conjuring, the Perron family plays this weird clapping game, a form of hide-n-seek that involves blindfolding a person who is then left to feel her way blindly around the house searching for others. This game sets up tension as we, the audience, can see what ghostly booby-trap the blindfolded person is headed toward.  GREG: Sadly for me, Scott, that scene you mentioned was in the trailer and I fully expected the event. Anticipation creates suspense and if that anticipation is ruined by a spoiler, there can be no suspense. I also had trouble with the internal logic of this movie. Why was a police officer part of the Warren party? Why would a witch hang herself after a blood sacrifice? This was supposedly a survivor of the Salem witch trials - wouldn t she want to stay alive to reap the benefits of her sacrifice? Why did the ghost-maid claim she made me do this when showing off her slit wrists? I really tried to suspend my disbelief but there is only so much I can ignore before the forces of logic intrude. When I compare this movie to The Amityville Horror (another movie based on one of the Warren s cases) I just don t see the appeal. That movie at least made sense within its own universe. The Conjuring was a confusing mess.  SCOTT: What The Conjuring lacks in originality, it makes up for in execution. For example, a staple of the horror genre is a creepy child s doll. The Conjuring features one of the more disturbing-looking dolls I ve ever seen, a doll named Annabelle who malevolently torments everyone around her. The old creeky house with its secret compartments makes for a perfect setting for a movie of this type. Ed and Lorraine have a nice backstory that gives them credibility as spook-hunters. All the elements are aligned here for a classic scary movie. If I had a problem with the film, it was with the supreme idiocy of the Perron family for staying in the house once the first signs of deep trouble were made clear. Let s face it -- If an invisible entity was grabbing your foot in the middle of the night, repeatedly, wouldn t you consider sleeping in a different bed, say, thousands of miles away?  GREG: Well, Scott, you appear to have enjoyed yourself in this movie. I think you ll get a chance to enjoy more of the same. One plot device that was exposed is the Warren s museum of paranormal objects. For some reason, they keep all the haunted objects from their adventures in a closet in their home. I foresee a sort of Night Gallery where each sequel explores the backstory of one of these objects. The number of sequels could be endless. I, on the other hand, was supremely insulted by this film. It made no sense and did not keep me in suspense for a minute. I forgot this film before I made it to the car to drive home. I was never frightened and I didn t feel the need to sleep with the lights on. In fact, I was bored most of the time. For a ridiculous plot and uninspiring bit of storytelling I give The Conjuring 1 Reel out of 5. I wasn t sure who the heroes in this film were. Nobody really seemed to learn a lesson or exhibit a sense of transformation. Still the Warrens did come to the aid of the witless family and help them despite personal danger. I give them 1 Hero out of 5. Movie: Heroes:  SCOTT: I liked The Conjuring more than you did, Greg, because I believe it nicely fulfilled its purpose of delivering a diabolically scary tale. The Perron family displayed just the right dose of innocence and likeability, and Ed and Lorraine were the smart, moral heroes who helped rid the wholesome family of the curse. I wasn t bowled over by The Conjuring but it delivered enough frightening, sphincter-tightening moments to make me happy. What we have here is a fairly well-crafted story of demonic possession that doesn t cover any new ground but still managed to give me my money s worth of jitters. I give the film 3 Reels out of 5. I agree with you, Greg, that the hero story played second-fiddle to the overarching goal of producing scary moments. For that reason, I generously award Ed and Lorraine 2 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Heroes:", "Strips down most cliches of modern horror, relies on developing-- and fulfilling-- a spooky atmosphere like arthouse horror, but still has an abundance of jump-out-scares.", "Tense, fresh, and expertly directed by James Wan, The Conjuring is one of the best modern horror movies. The body count is surprisingly low, there are minimal fake out jump scares, and the possession imagery a la Evil Dead is very welcome. Not all of the acting is good, but the chemistry between Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga is amazing. All in all, The Conjuring is an extremely well-made film from a director who knows what he's doing.", "Above average ghost flick in a market drowning in them the way the 80s were drowning in slasher flicks. Two of my favorite horror flicks, Poltergeist and The Exorcist, are represented here. And why not, they are arguably Top 5 in horror. Creep ass dolls have always freaked me out, almost as much as clowns. Love Chucky and Annabel is only a small part to this story but easily my favorite part. A strong lead performance by Vera Farminga and excellent direction by James Wan make this demonic treat worthy of repeated viewings.", "Comparison of all the conjuring movies. Conjuring 2: more story a little less scary than the original. Conjuring: a little less story but the scariest than 2. Annabelle: Less story than conjuring 1-2 but still scary. Annabelle: Creation the scariest along with The first Conjuring. Annabelle: Creation also has the best ending.", "The fact that it's based on a true story is what makes it scary", "Other than James Wan's direction, there's nothing very special about this run of the mill horror flick. I can see why people enjoy it, but it followed too many tropes to a T for it to ever surprise me.", "A gem amongst a genre filed with poorly created films, The Conjuring brings its own uniqueness to a series of events catalogued in many horror films before it. While its accuracy in terms of it being 'based on a true story' may be questioned, the producers and the directors have made a truly chilling film, and it's no surprise to see it spanning its own series (even if they aren't as good).", "Definitely one of my favorite horror movies. Great acting and plot, and I love the 70s setting. They don't jump straight in to the scary elements right away, but it definitely isn't slow either. Overall it's great. I wish more horror movies were like this one.", "This was like old classic horror that I really enjoyed", "The Conjuring is a creepy and very well-told (supposedly) true haunting that brings out genre classic moments and powerful protagonists.", "Great awesome scariest movie I've ever seen in my life starring some random people but were fantastic , truly believable. I can't wait to see the sequel to this because I want more incite in this franchise, I want to see more Annabelle and or she can have her own movie. Truly remarkable movie that is so scary, I've never experienced anything more malevolent in my life.", "The Conjuring is just terrifying. The movie made me jump, scream, and it really made me nervous with the suspense. This movie really balances the storytelling part and the scary part. This movie is practically scary and suspenseful from start to finish. The cast is great in this movie. They all did a good job and portrayed their characters well. This movie really makes the true story it's based on even more horrifying. I don't think this is the best horror movie of all time but it's definitely better than some recent ones. A", "Starts slowly, but minute by minute it builds quite a memorable ending.", "I had heard so much about based on true story film, \" the Conjuring \" from word of mouth that I finally decided to check it out. And I had to admit that I enjoyed myself and thought it was well worth seeing. Everyone may have their own view as to what is considered really \" scary\" to themselves. But I have to at least say that I found the Conjuring definitely to be \" creepy\" enough to enjoy.  With the Conjuring - which I tip my hat to the director James Wan and writers - because not only did I think this film had some creepy and jittery \"jump-scare\" moments in the film, but I also liked the way the dark areas of the house, the rooms, the corners, basement, stairs dark areas were displayed , they made it look eerie and macabre ( that\\'s been an missing element in horror films for decades, IMO) Much like the room the possessed girl Regan was tied up in the Exorcist. Speaking of which, in terms of it being a demon-possession flick, it ( nor any other \"entity\" movie will ever be in that class) Slowly creaking opening doors,.. bouncing objects, ..strange vibrations,.. shadows in the corner, ..dark- creepy hallways, ..powerful stench odors, ..unexplained physical yanking and bruises, ..dead animals, etc. And I thought the whole haunting demonic origin was well told.  The way the film started out did remind me very much of the Amityville Horror, but unlike that film and it\\'s ghostly encounters, it was well explained in this film why the terrified family group could not just pack up and leave. I liked that the Conjuring more centered on atmosphere than with a lot of excess blood and gore and superficial CGI effects.   There was only a couple of instants where director James Wan let that slip, primarily at the end. I also liked that it had a very brief documentary-like atmosphere where you felt part of the investigating ghost-crew with the rolling camera. The creepy sounding and wide screen camera angles were terrific and the cast and characters were well scripted and portrayed admirably.  Particularly Lily Taylor and Vera Farmiga.  I didn\\'t really get into the \" Annabelle \" doll, which was supposed to be one of the \" gateway\" tools to which demon spirits emerged into the lives of the living humans, I thought that the ending which one gets possessed to murder,- could have been a lot more intense and dramatic. While the credits rolled at the end, you get to see the pictures of the real couple who the film was based that actually investigates Occult like haunting back In the 60\\'s and 70\\'s.  Overall I thought this film was a solid film that gives some spooky chills and thrills in periods of the movie, and although I was initially concerned that this would be one of those films where the trailer itself ends up being much better, exciting that the actual movie itself- I can say that\\'s not the case here, and I was very much put at ease on that note after I finished watching the film. This should easily be one of the scariest movies of the year.  Too add I think it\\'s an greater advantage and enjoyable thrill to see this at the movie theaters with the much greater sights and surrounding sounds vs at home on DVD or streaming. On a Scale of 1 to 10, I\\'d give The Conjuring a 8.0", "Wan continues to prove himself in helming a macabre and unique horror film which perfectly builds tension and holds the breath every time.", "A Bone-Chilling movie that'll give you devilish nightmares for years to come.", "Extremely enjoyed. I'm new to horror movies but was not disappointed.", "This by far the scariest movie I have seen. However, if you don't believe in ghosts or demons, then it will not scare you as much as it did me. Still, it was an excellent piece of horror, with good directing, acting, and setting.", "Horrifying visuals and an eerie soundtrack make this a tense, entertaining, shit-your-pants scary film!", "This movie is well-crafted and creepy. I didn't get all that invested until about the 40 minutes mark but it does become an entertaining horror film from there. There are a few jump scares but thankfully the film doesn't rely on them.", "The movie had an interesting story with creepy imagery and a great cast. Besides the few cliche moments, James wan really through some new and great jump scares. Over well James Wan proves that he can do a lot with just a creepy doll.", "This movie is rated R just because its scary. Do I have to say anything else.", "The reality of demons and what they could do, frightens all.  The Perron family, consisting of a father, mother, and five daughters, sink all of their money into a new home, only to discover that it is haunted by a demonic presence, a witch that, after being caught trying to sacrifice her newborn child in the name of Satan, hung herself out of love for him instead. Needless to say, family time quickly becomes fright night.  The daughters aren\\'t given a whole lot of background or personalization, except for April, who connects to one of the more docile spirits. It would seem the reasoning for this is because the witch targeted April from the beginning, as we find out towards the end of the film.  All things considered, the reason that \"The Conjuring\" is such a good horror film isn\\'t because of its jump-scares, its hellish images, or the diabolical behavior of the demon-witch. The horror in this movie comes from the concept of spiritualism, how both the forces of good and evil can be overwhelmingly compelling...even enough to cause a mother to murder her own child, a horror most parents cannot fathom. What makes all of this so frightening is the possibility of it becoming a reality for the viewer, and how it makes one wonder, just what the hell is out there.", "Enough to scare the hell out of you..", "One of the most terrifying movies.", "The Conjuring is a movie that is based on a true story and stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. The Conjuring is a really good and scary movie. The acting is great, the cast is REALLY good, the story is very frightening and good as well. The cinematography is outstanding in this film! The jump scares in this film really keep up with the mood of the film.

Very scary. The sequel however, was just awful.", "..........BOO! If you find that terrifying then this film is probably for you. Personally I struggled to go along with this film after the opening 10-15secs when a girl straight faced tells the 'Demonologist' (seriously...give me strength) that they let the little girl 'Inhabit their doll'. It's just nonsense and the more you shine a light on that and treat it with po-faced seriousness the more ridiculous it all seems I'm afraid.", "Nothing new here but entertaining.", "It's been a while since we've had a horror film like this.

There is no real tension, just alot of screaming and a quick succession of jump scares.", "Like the film a lot but there is a problem w why does it even have a rated R rating just for scares", "I was captivated from the very beginning. So real my instinct was to run away from this movie! James Wan you've taken a real life event and drawn our imaginations to where it points Fear Factor! Could not fault the whole movie. Nothing screams real like the actors facial expressions and what's worse is you know this has happened to a real life family.  If you are a critic that says this latest technology does not scare me well see this movie. James Wan takes us further than that.

I would recommend if you are in mood for classic horror!", "Superb horror film because of the immensely talented cast. Not since Linda Blair's exorcism has another exorcism so engrossing for me.

Celebrate them.", "this was my 2nd fav movie", "The Conjuring uses old school scares and camerawork to potentially terrify viewers. One of the very few modern horror movies that does not rely on cheap jump scares or tricks to frighten you. The camerawork is great in this movie, often lingering on whatever horrifying creature is on the screen instead of quickly cutting away or having something pop out at you. The Conjuring manages to build suspense very well leading to a heart-thumping pay off that is fast-paced and intense. The acting is pretty good across the board, there wasn\\'t really one actor that stood out to me as being very good or bad. The script is fine, other than the occasional cheesy line here or there (Ex: during the middle of Carolyn\\'s exorcism, Roger Perron asks \"Are you okay?\") and a few horror cliches. I also had a problem with Annabelle, who seemed to only be in this movie for the purpose of making a sequel. Other than that, I found minimal problems with The Conjuring, and if you\\'re looking for a modern day horror movie that uses classic scares, this is for you.", "'The Conjuring' offers up one spine tingling moment after the next.

This movie was definitely scary &amp; chilling. The movie was based on a true story of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren who were helping the Perron family who experienced paranormal happenings at their Rhode Island home. What I liked about this picture was that I loved the whole retro-70's look of it from the cars to the clothes. Even the opening credits looked like a 70's film. Also, I liked the fact that the movie is an old school horror film which uses sound effects and darkness to scare audiences. I loved the cinematography of the movie. Also, I liked how the film was directed by James Wan. As for the acting, I thought it was wonderful, especially by Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren. I liked the fact that it wasn't only a horror film, but somewhat a love story between Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren. This film started slowly but builds up to the great scares.

I'd watch this movie during the day if you get scared easily. Definitely watch this one!", "It's nothing new but The Conjuring is down right terrifying! There were very good moments of suspense and overall brings the chiche haunted house film to a high standard.

It's not that frightening for experienced horror fans, but it's a structurally exceptional film thanks to great pacing and devoted direction from James Wan. Based on the true story of a haunted farmhouse in 1971 Rhode Island, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren document the haunting of the Perron family through their experience and trust within the Catholic Church. The Conjuring is unique because it revolves around real people, The Warren's, and the telling of their story and the story of this haunting. It's a slow-building thriller at first, with brilliant use of audio to conjure up scares, see what I did there? No, but seriously, Wan uses sound to create creepy scares throughout his films, and it's used so effectively in The Conjuring. The scares come often towards the second and third acts, mostly due to Wan's creative direction and strong acting. As one of the highest grossing horror films of all time, it could be compared to this generations, The Exorcist. James Wan has been an excellent contributor in bringing the horror genre back to life.

Well executed.", "SLICK movie. Very good. Excellent story and a minimum of cheap jump scares, almost no gratuitous gore. The creepy doll garbage seems a bit like a trend-riding afterthought that was probably shoehorned in after the rest of the move was already made. Unnecessary.

I\\'m not fond of horror films in general, and I wasn\\'t particularly interested in a horror film that was dubbed \"the scariest movie of the last decade.\" But as an avid film fan, I owed it to myself to give it a shot. I was not disappointed.  A horror film in the theaters is definitely different than viewing it in the comfort of your own home in the middle of the day, but The Conjuring still had a significant impact on me. James Wan brilliantly directs this supernatural flick about a family of 7 dealing with a relentless dark presence in their newly purchased home. It wasn\\'t even so much the demon itself or the endless number of terrifying jumps, but the fact that this was based on a true story.  Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play Ed and Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators who take on the case after the events escalate. I\\'m sure there were plenty of liberties taken, but The Conjuring is a far more grounded horror film than I expected. Wan does a nice job of building the characters out in full before we get overwhelmed with thrills in the second half. At its core, this is a character piece. And even to a certain extent, a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren. This wasn\\'t a horror film built around scares and gore, it was built around characters. Wan and his writers, Chad and Carey Hayes, deserve a ton of credit for that.  Part of the creepiness to this film comes from what you don\\'t see. There isn\\'t a ton of scares early on, and the stuff in camera does a lot to set the mood. But the final 30 minutes is about as thrilling of a finale in a horror film than I can remember. I felt a combination of not being able to take my eyes off the film whilst being absolutely terrified to what was on screen. It\\'s certainly well-acted, but Wan and the Hayes brothers are absolutely the stars of this film.  +Thrilling finale  +Grounded and well thought out  +Takes its time with characters  8.7/10", "The Conjuring is one of the greatest horror movies of the last sixteen years and relies on genuine scares over blood and gore. One of the few movies I have trouble watching alone.", "I usually find the horror genre a little boring but James Wans work is often thoroughly entertaining, he's one of the masters of modern horror movies. The Conjuring is disturbing I didn't find it very scary but it was very uncomfortable. This is down to a indescribable atmosphere that is created, often the case with Wans work such as Insidious. An impressive cast assisted a somewhat predictable plot and theme which has been done over, however rarely has it been delivered with such quality. You believe the fear and give into the terror not really knowing is coming next. The Conjuring is satisfying and will not be easy for people to watch, because its done well.", "I am a horror movie fanatic and thought that this movie was great all around. Great cast, great story line, plenty of scary moments.

Hayes Directed By:James Wan Unlike most people I have never seen a good modern paranormal/demon horror film. I've seen paranormal activity's one and two and I hated them. But last year there was this trailer about a horror film called the conjuring and every one was excited and everyone saw it but me. What caught my attention is when everyone said it was one of the best horror films ever. The other little piece of goodness was the possessed creepy doll and considering I'm a fan of creepy dolls I had to see it. The film is based on true events of two ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren who help a family that is being haunted and one family member possessed by an evil entity that will latch to whoever is living on their land. I don't know how much of the story is true but I do know for a fact that I was expecting to be really scared but instead I was frightened, creep-ed out of my mind, the fact that unlike other demon,paranormal, exorcism movies this one was based on a true story which I believe helped the film, don't you sometimes hear things at night. James Wan is one of my favorite directors especially when it comes to the horror genre, he made one of my all time favorite horror movies that scared me as a boy that I still watch to this day the very first Final Destination from 2000. Which was a very creepy dark horror film about paranormal deaths conflicted by the grim reaper because someone had a vision and didn't die and they would be picked off one by one. Wan also produced a lot of the X-Files episodes and he's really good at building tension and suspense. The only problem I do have with this movie and I'm pretty sure you will too is that it's poorly paced in the beginning of the picture. But once more stuff starts to happen in the house and the family meets the Warrens it starts booming and it stays booming. You'll be on the edge the rest of the movie. The movie has really good performances especially from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga they were the best thing about this film. YOu could tell that they gave their all into these two characters. LILI Taylor is also amazing as the distressed mother who is experiencing all of this strange stuff going on around her and her family. The Conjuring is one of the best paranormal/Demon/Horror movie I have ever seen so far. The performances are top notch, the movie is very creepy and frighting and James Wan got some rally nice shots with his camera work but it is poorly paced in the beginning so I'm going to give The Conjuring a four and a half out of five.", "James Wan still impresses me. This is a slam dunk horror film that will make you scream and cower like a little child!", "Uhhhhhhhh. James Wan has an art form in horror directing, it especially shows in Insidious 1 and the sequel. This movie really falls short from the same old horror movie tropes and brings life to a new type of great, classic horror. This movie manages to not only live up to the expectations, but also blend in a great amount of drama to make the story just all that more realistic. (Whether the story is true or not)", "A solid horror movie that doesn't need all the blood and gore like most of today's horror movies.", "With strong emotion at its core, excellent cinematography, editing and score, a superb direction from James Wan and very good performances, The Conjuring is technically superb, but it is also excellent in its storytelling and so detailed in its approach. It is a film that has well developed characters for whom you care about and feel sorry for, it has a familiar but so well told story, it is so moving at times and, most importantly, it is consistently elaborate and satisfying in its scares and sometimes even being truly frightening. It is one of the best horror films of all time.", "\"The Conjuring\" is hands-down the best horror movie of the 21st century. Sure, it uses the most stereotypical plot in horror history with a family moving into a new house that\\'s old, creepy, and in a woodland area and the ghosts of murdered people haunt them, but with amazing camerawork and direction by James Wan, it still feels fresh. One of the best things about this movie is, I saw almost every single jumpscare coming, but it still managed to get me every time. The tension and suspense is built up perfectly to a great scare. Also, there are some old school, edge of your seat creepy scenes in it too that send chills down the spine. This blend of modern-era horrors and old clich\u0102\u0160 scares refined to perfection makes this my personal favorite horror movie, and the only horror movie to ever actually scare me.", "The Conjuring is an immediate classic, with a great storytelling based in actual facts and people, and even greater performances.", "Quite possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen", "A genuinely creepy thriller with great special effects and editing that adds up to one of the better horror movies in years.

Really scared the shit out of me on that second and third viewing. Wilson and Farmiga are great and there is some great old fashioned jump out of your seat moments. A rare treat and breath of fresh air in an era where horror is dominated with gore over content. Oh and that fucking doll freaked me out.", "A creepy flick that attempted a couple unconventionally scares. It is good to see film makers who try to steer away from the usual predictable tactics of the horror genre. Conjuring is deserving of it's hi ratings.", "Really do not see the attraction to this overblown, cheap, cheesy, upside down cross, typical clique movie about possession.  Insidious was far superior.  I suspect that this played more on base emotions, so it was relate-able to teenagers and youngsters which were obviously the target audience R+ or not.  Honestly, i can not believe the rating this has, and the relativity low rating Insidious has.  I supposed Insidious was just not for the masses, it was a more specialised psychological horror film which took a little brain power to figure out, where as The Conjuring was a simple, Great looking man + his Great looking wife and their \"True Cases\" regardless of the fact that their has never been one ounce of physical evidence to support what they claim.  This movie was one of boyfriends and girlfriends sitting in the back rows making out and possibly getting the odd handy. Like most typical horrors now days, they seem to be more of a place and time to make out because kids cant do it at home, so they need some privacy.  The story line was lame, predictable, filled with lame jump scares and not 1 single actual scary scene. The Banal narrative was one we have seen a million times, with no difference aside from the fact that they used every single clique in the book this time as if Thinking if they hit them all, they would please everyone. lol.... What got me the most was the blatant *SPOILERS* rip off of the exorcist near the end where the Wife is possessed and she blurts out some lines from the exorcist. They even try and make her look similar to Reagan   Yeha nah, this movie does not even hold a candle to Insidious.. let alone to The Exorcist.", "Second one is better.", "Even though it has a familiar plot, \"The Conjuring\" still manages to surprise with its brilliant scares.", "A modern horror masterpiece.

When the scares were not in center stage, there was a constant feeling of tension and fear and it was clear that something was terribly wrong with the house. One of the best features about this film is the soundtrack and score, combining old school 70's vibe songs and a truly haunting score that sets the tone for each scene.

Is it me or do modern horror films just don't do it? In I mean they provide little scary moments.

This is a very well made movie; cinematography and sound design is top notch and really contributes to some absolutely chilling scenes. The climax is just silly and kills the momentum of the horror. The dialogue is just awful and isn't done any favors by the poor acting. The Annabelle stuff was a distraction that took away from the main plot - it's obvious now they were just promoting the stand-alone Annabelle movie.   All-in-all, a solidly scary exorcism movie that showcases Wan's talents, but would have benefited from better writing.", "Better than your typical demon movie. Wan yet again, proves he's probably the best when it comes to your modern day horror film. Overall I thought it was good, but not great. From the critic reviews and what I have heard from people I know personally, I went into the film with super high expectations so its perfectly normal for me to feel a little disappointed. The story and acting from the entire cast were superb and I definitely recommend it.

I borrowed the DVD from JT. It was well done on several levels. The cinematography, direction, acting, props were all very good. It just really wasn't scary and didn't fell very original either. I like the director though. he has done good things for the horror genre. i hope the sequel is better.", "Brilliantly put together.

This movie excels in an entertaining and coherent story, a fantastic cast, great prodution design and photography and thrilling scares that not only relies on loud noises and unexpected jump scares. Yes, it is similar to other movies of the genre like Poltergeist and The Exorcist but it succesfully brings that thematic to the modern audiences. Plus, it has something not a lot of other movies have: The Warrens. James Wan succesfully builds an entire mythology around them and makes you care about them and continue to watch their adventures.", "The Conjuring is what I would describe as a cliched but solid homage to old school horror films. The Conjuring isn't what I would call original, it's cliched in every sense of the word, there's strange noises, doors creak, picture frames fall, and jump scares are present throughout, which are in every other horror movie you ever saw, so what makes The Conjuring stand out of all the other cliched Hollywood horror movies? James Wan has this way of creating a eerie atmosphere using breathtaking camera shots and a loud soundtrack to it's advantage. I can't really say the film overly scared me however, even though Wan is able to create a dark atmosphere, the jump scares were still vaguely obvious. Even though the jump scares don't overly succeed in scaring the viewers genuinely, and they sometimes come off pretty forced, there's still enough tension to make the movie at least creepy and spine-tangling. The plot of the movie is pretty simple, a family moves into a new home, and start experiencing strange things, and with the help from Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson), the family tries to uncover the truth about what happened on their newly owned land, and what exactly is attacking their family. The overall story is pretty contrived, it gets ridiculous at times, but it doesn't take away from the tension-filled scenes at all, which is really good for a horror film. The acting was surprisingly solid, nothing amazing, but nothing bad by any means, and I actually cared for the characters, it's a shame that the characters can be incredibly stupid at times, which isn't all that surprisingly since characters tend to be dumb in horror movies. Usually when horror movies don't necessarily show the demonic spirit, it's naturally more scary since that's when the audiences imagination comes into play, and their own image they create in their mind of the demonic spirit will most likely haunt them more, so I guess that's my biggest problem with not just The Conjuring, but with Wan's Insidious also, the demonic spirit was shown physically in both movies. Psychological horror movies like The Shinning, The Babadook (which is on Netflix by the way and is certainly worth watching), and The Witch (certainly worth watching also, definitely rent it from the Redbox) don't rely on jump scares and don't overly show the evil spirits and antagonists, sometimes the less you see, the scarier it is. The Conjuring is a solid horror movie that pays homage to old horror movies like The Exorcist, and offers tension-filled scenes using dark atmosphere and a haunting soundtrack, but fails to deliver something memorable and truly terrifying. Andrew's Grade: B-", "One of the scariest movies I've ever seen.

If I had one nitpick it is that we don't really get to know the dad character (or Office Space guy) that well and I feel that he was just there when the film required him to be there.

Since films like \"Psycho\" or \"The Exorcist\" were released, horror has been mocked, satirized, remade, and turned into a money-hungry genre instead of making a film for genuine audience thrills. James Wan has proven that there are still ways to keep this genre alive. \"The Conjuring\" not only proves that, but also finds a place on many horror fans lists of favourite horror films. Balancing thrills, a chilling story, and great performances all around, this film stands out among the endless films in this genre nowadays.  Back in 2007 when \"Paranormal Activity\" was released, viewers found themselves engrossed in a new format of horror storytelling, but what nobody saw coming was the endless copycats and sequels that film would spawn. Any chance that studios or filmmakers in general can get, they will run with the newest trend. The budget of horror films nowadays is a joke. Independent film companies release their films for a few million dollars and see over a 50 million dollar return in profits, which convicts them to make multiple sequels and roll in as much dough as possible and milk their metaphorical cow clean.  Happily, \"The Conjuring\" (even though it is far better than \"Paranormal Activity) is following in the footsteps of \"Paranormal Activity,\" where it brings a very fresh cinematography style to the table, engrossing audiences all over the world in it\\'s atmosphere. There is so much to love about every technical aspect here and the eerie scenery, mixed with genuinely terrifying performances, makes for a very solid horror film.  Following Ed and Loraine Warren as they investigate paranormal occurrences, they come across the Perron\\'s. They have recently moved into a new house that they won from an auction, and although it is a bit of a \"fixer upper,\" they stick with it until the hauntings become far too great for them to handle. They consult the Warren\\'s and all hell begins to break loose. From jump scares to cliched horror plots, \"The Conjuring\" walks a fine line of predictable and lame, but manages to stay fresh due to it\\'s awesome direction by James Wan, extremely impressive camerawork, and very solid performances from the entire cast. \"The Conjuring\" is what the Hollywood horror genre needed.

Have I been too spoiled by horror movies that use jump-scares and popping visuals every 5 minutes, that I can't appreciate a truly atmospheric chiller, that is scarce in its display of gore? Is it because I was hoping for a ghost to incessantly jump out, that I cannot value a smartly-written horror flick? Is my horror threshold just too high that a couple of noises in the dark, the sound of door creaking, people's limbs being pulled in their sleep and bangs on the wall just won't do it for me? Whatever the case may be, I expected so much more from Wan's latest highly-promising horror flick, that in the end, the payoff was suffice to say, critically lacking. Though there was nothing wrong with the movie in terms of cinematography, it could probably do with more scary imagery in its storytelling.", "one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.", "Warmly nostalgic and aesthetically pleasing, The Conjuring offers a light, old-fashioned haunted house story loaded with the requisite jump scares and bolstered with a heartwarming affection for family togetherness, adding up to an energetic, family-friendly and above all fun frightfest.", "The Conjuring is a deeply scary film that expertly crafts frightening imagery and tension to make the audience clench their seats.

I respect Wan for not hopping on the bandwagon and just putting jump scares in this movie. He relies on building tension and then delivering the scare.

While I was disappointed with that aspect, Wan did a great job making the family feel real and all the relationships feel legit. Overall \"The Conjuring\" is an okay film, but misses its mark at being terrifying.", "The Conjuring stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmigan as Ed and Lorraine Warren, a married couple of \"paranormal investigators\" who are reached out to by a family living in the woods about supernatural activity. This movie and its characters are based off of true case files. James Wan is a veteran in the field of horror; he wrote and directed the first Saw movie, as well as producing each sequel, and he directed the first two installments of the Insidious series. Despite what you may think of those franchises, there\\'s no denying his influence in the horror genre, and this movie is an absolute slam dunk! Like all good horror movies, The Conjuring starts slow and steady - the family gradually discovers more and more strange occurrences before finally contacting the Warrens, and then the Warrens have to establish a way of tracking whatever spirits dwell on this land. As the truth behind the spirits is revealed, the Warrens\\' backstories are fleshed-out. Lorraine, a clairvoyant, has had difficulties with her previous encounters, and Farmiga\\'s performance as this troubled individual really stands out among the crowd. James Wan\\'s craft has been perfected over the years to establish this product; he truly understands how to evoke reactions out of his audience members through his use of lighting, cameras, and music.

Now, 'The Babadook', now that's a recent horror movie I can get behind.", "It's always interesting to note the first person affected by the demonic possession, and then to what extent. Here, the former is less relevant than the latter. The mother is possessed by the demonic spirit, Bathsheba. She has to remember that she loves her children in order to overcome the possession, which rather than the exorcism is what truly saves her. Horror has a very troubling relationship with women and especially mothers. They are always put through ghastly trials, it seems, in order to earn or prove something. They generally come out triumphant, but not before being subjected to a hellish ordeal.", "Proof that when you put enough care and attention into it, a traditional-style horror film can still hold up today, even if it is treading familiar ground.  There's a real sense of dread and the film doesn't feel like it's playing cheap tricks on you, and these alone make it better than the majority of modern horror films. Its premise is old-school to the extreme and it embraces that with its funky 70s aesthetic.   I would have liked to have seen it push some boundaries but, honestly, at this point I'm just happy to see a modern horror film that isn't a complete waste of my time.   Maybe the sequel will experiment a little more but I doubt it. Still, I'm looking forward to it thanks to the strength of this one. There's certainly still a place for conventional horrors like this one, as long as they manage not to suck.", "I find myself getting annoyed by all recent exorcism/possession movies as there is nothing innovative. The Conjuring changes that. It sets itself apart from all the others with its chilling sequences and storytelling.", "pretty solid horror flick", "While not great, it was a good movie. One thing this has going for it is the fact that it didn't succumb to modern horror cliches. There weren't loud sounds preceding or paired with a scare. The acting was good and the story over all was kind of interesting. Though I wouldn't say this was in the least bit scary and it could have been since it did away with the music stings in an ironic twist. Things just happen, and sometimes you have to be rather astute to catch the reveal before they blatantly show it. I wouldn't watch it again since it did get boring at times.  With that said, I must commend the makers of this movie since they did go a more clever route and did break away from the stereotypical horror mold, by bringing the genre back to a time when you couldn't afford to go to stockmusiclibrary(dot)com and look under horror. I just wished it was more interesting.", "one of the best films i seen in years", "The Conjuring is a movie that is true to the Horror genre.

As it turns out, there's very little truth to any stories told by hoaxers Ed and Lorraine Warren who have made a fortune with their real life ghostbuster bullshit. Previous Hollywood hits based on their files include The Amityville Horror and A Haunting as well as a string of telefilms and TV shows. The Conjuring portrays the couple as heroes (played by the talented Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) but I am not entirely sure people who take money to perform exorcisms on the schizophrenic and mentally ill deserve the favourable treatment they get if this is meant to be a true story affair. Not that this is ever mentioned in the film that sometimes seems to have been made to order by the Catholic Church. Definitely and elegantly creepy stuff with a tagline based on profitable made up events would be more like it but I get there would be no market appeal. If you ever have the time please search for the one-hour-long YouTube rant of the current resident of the real house in the film who is suing the producers and has had her life turned upside down after her property became a tourist attraction drawing tons of fans of the film. It's better than the movie.", "Loved it. It has the perfect combination of jump scares, plot scares and overall frightening atmosphere. The story is believable (given that this is a horror), and the participants all do a fine job of adding up to more than the sum of their parts. From the introduction of Ed and Lorraine, to the Perron family realizing that their house has an issue, to the last third of the movie which contains the climax as well as a few surprises... The Conjuring just delivers more than it's fair share of scares, and the whole ordeal feels real. The movie plays out very well and the cinematography succeeds at everything it attempts to do. Don't believe for a second that this movie just relies on jump scares - it does far, far more than that.", "I usually don't like horror movies for 2 reasons. The first is because I don't find them scary because I know it's fake, and they usually aren't made very well. But I kind of liked this movie, I think the reason I did is because the actors were pretty good in it and it was a creepy movie.

The acting is done quite well with some research done to stay relative to the real life story that his film is derived from. A great horror flick that will keep you in suspense and eager to find out the ending.", "The Conjuring has a pretty basic supernatural horror film premise, but it stands out from the pack due to its terrific atmosphere and great acting. It uses very blantant scares, there is not much scepticisim aout whether or not the house is actually haunted, the characters are obviously experiencing some serious shit and they know it immediately. the hide and clap aspect was fantastic, overall this film has one downfall, the annabelle doll seemed to be a device to guarantee a spin-off film, which they eventually did (it sucked). and the father was not developed, he was just there not doing much. this is one of the best horror films in recent memory. 4.2/5", "James Wan has shown with films like Saw and Insidious that he understands horror and how to breathe freshness into a genre that is becoming exhausted and overbearing, and The Conjuring is his best film to date. Directed with a stylistic flare and engaging aesthetic that is lacking in his other features, this period piece is captivating from its chilling opening scene (unfortunately inspiring a far less effective film in Annabelle) and has some truly terrifying sequences throughout, where Wan shows that he knows exactly when to show the audience something and when to leave it to their imagination. The cinematography and visual aesthetic is rich in character, and the sound design (including music choices, score and creative use of silence) is used to great effect in building tension and eliciting horror.  The entire cast deliver great performances (even the children), and Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga shine in their roles as real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.  The Conjuring confirms that James Wan is someone to watch within modern horror, breathing freshness into a cliche premise and truly showing how in building suspense and anxiety, less is more.", "I remember it being quite scary however I don't remember much of it Therefore I feel that I should take it down to 3 and a half stars.", "Old and tired script that's been done many times before.

Now I feel this is one of the better horror movies. It's creepy, it's suspenseful and definitely scary at some points. This is also definitely not the first movie that involved in exorcism. There are a handul of some jump scares but I felt there were more moments where I thought I was going to get a jump scare and it didn't happen. Especially throughout the first half of the movie, I guess that's more effective though. I personally felt this movie was more creepy than it was scary. Although there are still a few scenes that still make sleeping or walking in the dark especially difficult. overall, if you love scary horror movies, I say definitely check this one out. If you hate that stuff, than probably not, or just give this one a try and just now what you're getting yourself into and try not to be traumatized.", "It's real good and it has some creepy scenes!", "Annabelle, which I saw first is the prequel / spin-off to The Conjuring in the timeline of the films, this comes second.....BUT...this was the first released theatrically. This film is simply just GREAT. This film is great along the times of similar films like The Exorcism of Emily Rose. I didn't know what to expect. But I didn't expect it to be a Exorcism type of film. The supernatural genre consistently surprises me. It's the best of modern horror and it's always different, and it's not a bloated genre like slasher films.   The film has a pretty nuts plot, but unlike films that started the whole haunted house thing, it's not like the house is actually haunted rather than it is used as a channel to haunt the inhabitants. There are evil entities within the house and once they are expelled, the house is clean. This is different from say, The Amityville Horror. The house is not built onto Sacred Grounds. The backstory with Annabelle is very useful for character development and was am interesting lead-in to the plot and prequel...terrible choice of doll used though.   The characters that you are introduced to in the intro are really the most important characters in the film. In some ways, the plot is difficult or confusing to follow, but eventually it's all explained at a comfortable and easier to understand level.

I watch this movie all of the time. Thank you James Wan. Grade: 100% A+", "A great modern horror film that borrows some classic elements and cliches to make a very creepy and unsettling experience.", "There\\'s no shortage of ghost stories in the world of cinema, but in recent years, we\\'ve been treated to some good ones, like James Wan\\'s \"Insidious\" (2011), Scott Derrickson\\'s \"Sinister\" (2012), and most recently, \"The Conjuring\" (2013), also directed by Wan. The three all have their merits, but I found \"The Conjuring\" to be the most effective. It doesn\\'t have the atmosphere or concept of \"Insidious\" or the grisly viscera of \"Sinister,\" but the name of the game is frights, and in that all-important category, it has the upper hand.   The film is ostensibly based on a true story, but I always take that disclaimer with a grain of salt, especially in this genre. Ed and Lorraine Warren were real life \"paranormal investigators,\" and the film documents one of their cases from the 1970s, but exactly how much of it is actual truth is likely subject to debate. I don\\'t know about the veracity of the underlying case itself, but even if it\\'s 100% authentic, there\\'s still no doubt the filmmakers took some dramatic licenses in order to make a better movie. And this is fine; I\\'m not here to debate about what did or didn\\'t happen. I just wanted to make it clear that the \"true story\" aspect didn\\'t really make the film any more or less scary to me. Looking at it as a fictionalized version of events, it\\'s a highly effective horror movie.   Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston star as Carolyn and Roger Perron, a blue-collar couple who moves into a secluded Rhode Island farmhouse with their five daughters in the fall of 1971. Almost immediately, strange phenomena begins to occur. Pictures fall off the wall. Every clock in the house stops at 3:07 a.m. every night. Their youngest daughter begins to converse with an imaginary friend, whom she claims lives in the house too. Gradually, the events begin to escalate, becoming more and more threatening. It\\'s clear that there\\'s some kind of presence in the Perron household, and it means them harm. Enter Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson), a married couple who have an expertise in the supernatural and the occult. They take it upon themselves to learn the nature of the entity and to drive it out.   It all sounds so...unoriginal, right? We\\'ve seen this kind of thing countless times before, from \"The Amityville Horror\" to \"Poltergeist.\" But it\\'s important to note that the Warrens\\' work was actually the inspiration for these and other stories that have since been dramatized (again, assuming you\\'re willing to go along with the notion that these are true stories), so it\\'s a little unfair to penalize \"The Conjuring\" for that.   More importantly, the film is just plain scary. What it may lack in cinematic originality, it makes up for in its execution with some wickedly sinister set-pieces. The Perron daughters play a variation of Marco Polo with the call-and-response of the two names replaced with a series of claps, and it makes for some decidedly unsettling scenes when the uninvited house guest decides to join in on the game. I imagine that, after seeing this movie, there will be more than a few people who will go home and imagine hearing spectral clapping coming from somewhere in their walls.   Another part of the film\\'s appeal is how it seems so remarkably \"old-school.\" There\\'s very little gore, and oftentimes the film relies on the notion that what you don\\'t see is scarier than what you do. To be clear, the movie has its shares of visual scares as well, but it\\'s still not afraid to let the viewer\\'s imagination do the work for them on occasion. It\\'s a call-back to our childhood fears; the monster under the bed or hiding in the closet that we conjured in our mind was always far scarier than anything tangible. It\\'s a tricky thing to pull off, but \"The Conjuring\" succeeds.   As a result, the scares all feel genuine as opposed to a byproduct of cheap gimmicks. Wan handles the material with a deft and subtle touch. We do get jump-scares, yes, but they\\'re presented in a far lighter fashion. Wan doesn\\'t use the ole object-suddenly-jumps-into-the-frame-accompanied-by-loud-proclamation-on-the-soundtrack trope endlessly because he doesn\\'t have to. He lets the dread and apprehension build naturally without placing sole reliance on immediate shocks or \"gotcha!\" tactics. It\\'s more of a slow-burn technique, the kind of tactic John Carpenter employed at his peak. Wan is certainly no stranger to excess (his previous credits also include \"Saw\" and \"Death Sentence\"), but this film-and, to a lesser degree, \"Insidious\"-prove that subtlety can be one of his strengths as well.   As is often the case with this genre, things begin to lag as we approach the end of the film. The set-up is better than the payoff, and the climax is basically your standard \"Exorcist\" fare. But even then, there\\'s no denying the skill in its construction, and we as viewers still feel some of the impact as we\\'ve become invested in these characters. Credit the actors for this; in horror movies, it\\'s all too easy to simply fade in the background and let the ghosts/demons/monsters take over, but that\\'s not the case here. The entire cast is solid, with the stand-outs being Farmiga and especially Taylor. There\\'s something about Lili Taylor that makes her seem so...I don\\'t know, vulnerable and relatable. These are absolutely essential qualities in a story like this. If we don\\'t care about the characters, then it\\'s basically a \"Halloween/Friday the 13th/Nightmare on Elm Street\" sequel: bring on the slasher to dispatch these annoying people because we couldn\\'t care less about them!   It\\'s good to know that the horror genre is still capable of churning out films like \"The Conjuring\" and \"It Follows\" (and \"Sinister\" and \"Insidious,\" for that matter). Given all the in-name only \"horror\" films Hollywood craps out ad nauseam, it\\'s a genre that can very easily be taken for granted. But movies like these prove that, rare as they may seem to be, genuine scares are still out there to be had.", "The sequel to Annabelle  First of all I love the panning directional filming that is out standing compared to the first movie  It me Goosebumps in some parts of the movie   Story  Much better with more interesting characters   Great story line and visual effects and makeup   This is worthwhile watching", "Good stoy, really well acted. Not much to actually scare you here though.", "Lot of creepy moments. Great performances all around. Enjoyed this movie.", "Definitely one of the better demonic possession films. This good ol fashion suspense builder brings a really dark and yet, somehow fun feel to the seemingly crippling horror movie scene.  Great work, James Wan.", "The film pursuit of fusion fiction and reality makes it totally fun and scary to watch. Terrific performances from the leads. No cheap scares just calculated in crescendo surprises.", "Not since before 1973 has there been an inkling of interest in demonic possessions and exorcisms without feeling a shiver down the spine warning you of the sleepless nights you may encounter. In fact, that year produced perhaps the most iconic horror film there has ever been and can safely dictate why the horror genre is actually as popular and feared as it is today. The Exorcist took the world by storm and remains the pinnacle of a genre beloved by a few and dreaded by many. There has not been a film depicting demonic possessions and exorcisms even remotely as terrifying as The Exorcist once was and that is unquestionably because horror films over time forget what constituted in making a genuine horror film. Horror turned into blood, guts and a maniacal murderer running, chasing and killing like a cycle, as if the world had forgotten films like this have been made already. It is the psychological aspect of horror films that resonate with you and it is safe to say that the majority of horror films ever created lack this fundamental aspect of terror-inducing psychosis. The Conjuring however, does not! The Conjuring bridges your fears and primarily manages to grab your attention until your so consumed by this demonic farmhouse that you feel compelled to sit through the disturbing sequences because it makes for a powerful psychological thriller before it makes for a chilling horror story. The Conjuring as a horror film is as intense as The Exorcist ever was; it is the only truly terrifying horror film that has come to screens since perhaps the early 2000\u00e2??s.   The Conjuring focuses on the demonic infiltration of the Perron family who experience highly disturbing events in their house in 1971. They call for the assistance of proven paranormal investigators and authors of real-life cases, Ed and Lorraine Warren, who have scrutinised many a case including the infamous Amityville Horror. They soon find out the piece of land their house is located on had belonged to an accused witch named Bathsheba who sacrificed herself and child and cursed those that took her land. Unfortunately, the Perron\u00e2??s were the victims of her wrath and experience such a disturbance that the horror becomes amazing to witness. The nightly commotion the character\u00e2??s experience is so diverse in its shock factor, half of the time you are unprepared for parts you thought you were actually prepared for. As soon as the dog dies, frames start falling, children are (un)blanketed, wardrobes begin creaking, a devilish laughter echoes, there are apparitions of spirits, those spirits start stinking, and someone gets possessed of course! The Conjuring really does emphasise the ingredients needed for a demonic possession that by the film\u00e2??s conclusion you will have had your fair share of ghoulish scare for a while.   \u00e2??I've been seeing the dark entity that haunts your house and your land. I saw it first when I came through your door, it was latched to your back. And then I saw it again with the girls when we walked into the living room. And it doesn't matter where you go, this dark entity has latched itself to your family and it is feeding off you.\u00e2?? \u00e2?? Clairvoyant Lorraine Warren\u00e2??s bluntly put truth is emblematic of just how chilling this film can be. The horror is not for us to be seen, it is to be imagined, and seeing the shriveled faces of the traumatized Perron\u00e2??s knowing their horror, the film has become ten times as scary as anything seen in those awful slasher movies as your imagination is given the lease to run wild with trepidation. The Conjuring essentially like all horror films fuels a mixture of psychological and physical horror, but the difference is that it manages to get the balance dead-on. Of course the psychological factor is what creates a good horror film, and The Conjuring heavily imposes this feature on the film for the first 75 minutes making the first part soul tingling, but it does not neglect the physical aspect of horror. Horror is not just about sitting there worrying about lurking disturbances, after a while the characters are going to have to solve the underlying problem and are going to have to get physical with the demon that thirsts for them. Slasher films make this their integral feature and that is where so many of them go wrong. The Conjuring builds up with psychological horror, but ends with a frantic physicality that will leave you having experienced an overwhelming piece of cinema.   The Conjuring is not just about entertaining you through fear, but also educating you of the details of this supposedly otherworldly phenomenon. The Conjuring makes the idea of demons and possessions quite an interesting process that you are willing to watch the parts that have no shock value as intently as the parts that are certain to frighten. A scene that springs to mind involves both Ed and Lorraine Warren in one of their paranormal classes explaining the 3 stages of demonic ownership. Listen up folks\u00e2?\u015a Stage 1: INFESTATION: the most terrifying stage involving whispering, footsteps and the feeling of another presence. Stage 2: OPPRESSION: this involves the specific targeting of a victim that is psychologically vulnerable so their willpower can be crushed easier. And Stage 3: POSSESSION: the complete and utter loss of control of your body as a result of demonic infiltration. I bet you never knew that before\u00e2?\u015a neither did I! That is what diversifies The Conjuring from the growing horror pack as it knows when to scare you, when to let you breath and when to update your understandings with rich information.   Acting in a psychologically orientated horror film is always a hard task because actors have to act scared and traumatised even though everything around them is constructed for entertainment. Actresses Vera Farmiga\u00e2??s Lorraine Warren and Lili Taylor\u00e2??s Carolyn Perron are the standouts of a well-rounded cast. Vera Farmiga\u00e2??s acting as both a psychic and a psychologically drained woman from a previous exorcism makes her character\u00e2??s psychology extremely important. And Farmiga expresses her character\u00e2??s inner struggles so well that she almost seems someone different externally. Lili Taylor\u00e2??s performance as the hopeless Carolyn Perron is somewhat of another dimension to this film as her tormented character provides a new sort of obvious terror to the horror on show. The Conjuring is a convincing horror film only because its actors are so collectively strong that this world feels extremely inhabitable.   The Conjuring as a film is consuming in every way possible; the characters are consumed by fear, one character is literally consumed by a demon and you are consumed by its sheer dose of terrifying entertainment. Considering the film is supposed to be \u00e2??based on a true story,\u00e2?? entertainment may not be the right word to use\u00e2?\u015a perhaps \u00e2??life experiences\u00e2?? works better! The success of The Conjuring has already spawned a spin-off in Annabelle, and its sequel, The Conjuring: The Enfield Poltergeist is set for 2016. Way to go Hollywood\u00e2?\u015a yet again destroying the reputation of another great film!   The Verdict:   The Conjuring stands out from the pack of recent mediocre horror films by delivering a more psychological approach to its representations, which inherently is at the root of all of its success.   \u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2?? 9/10", "This right here is how it's fricken done", "This is a genuinely eerie horror film that is fun for any fan of the genre.

The major difference between this new age and the golden age is that filmmakers like James Wan won\\'t let us forget where the genre was born: chilling atmosphere, cold yet elegant cinematography, and genuine scares that don\\'t pander to the audience.  James Wan reminds me of the great horror filmmakers like Sam Raimi, William Friedkin, William Castle and so on in that he refuses to scare you with misinformation.

So, it\\'s a good thing that Ed(Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren(Vera Farmiga) have some experience with the supernatural.  To be fair, \"The Conjuring\" does have its share of jolts and scares. However, it can never sustain a high level of creepiness for very long, despite having the perfect setting. A lot of that has to do with the filmmakers apparently being more interested in establishing the Warrens\\' real life bona fides and exploring the various bureaucratic loopholes one has to go through in order to perform an exorcist than anything else.

The movie drags for the first 30 minutes though once it picks up, it moves along well. What worked nicely for this film at the beginning was its realism. It's creepy in a way that an average person could relate to. By the end though, the realism is pretty shot and the special effects take over.

The acting isn't half bad for a movie like this, but it's the same old story of, possession, creepy houses, exorcisms, blah, blah, blah. Is a creepy house and jumps enough to save a horror movie, well, it used to be, but I think that these just don't work anymore. What happened to the good old fashioned slasher flick, are they gone, or is the horror genre in general just dead. Either way, I don't think there is much of a course left for these types of movies.

Moving on, the opening scene is spooky, since here you can behold the stunning camera work; this little scene is about a possessed doll called Annabelle. This scene keeps the suspense and the scariness. There are two stories in the movie; the first one is about Lorraine and Ed Warren, they are two paranormal investigators, both have a little daughter and they live in a nice house. Then, there\\'s the other story about a likable family who has experienced some paranormal events in their new home. It doesn\\'t matter how cliche it sounds, this is a terrific horror film.  After the first 30 minutes or so, there are the first scares, all of them are very effective, unexpected and well executed. Even though I didn\\'t jump out of my seat (maybe because jump-scares are not effective in me and some of the scares were in the trailer) I have to admit that the film freaked me out so much, it boasts some extremely violent sequences and it was so damn thrilling at several moments. A few scares were pretty familiar and it\\'s true that it doesn\\'t offer something new to the horror genre, but it has enough creativity and originality to succeed. In addition, it is very similar in tone to \\'The Woman in Black\\', both have a well handled suspense and an atmospheric setting.  The performances were great, even the young cast was awesome. The most believable character in the film was Christine (performed by Joey King), this girl was excellent. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were good as always, Vera\\'s character \"Lorraine\" was a bit surreal but her stunning performance made me believe in all of what she said. Also, Lili Taylor did an excellent job with her role throughout the film, she was amazing, especially in the chilling final act. Moving on, the special effects were quite realistic and so well done. In spite of being a low budget film, it didn\\'t use too much CGI, maybe just in a couple scenes, but everything looks great anyway.  Its final act has some flaws, the exorcism scene has its ups and downs. However, I still liked it, this whole sequence is truly violent, a bit bloody and creepy. The acting was awesome here, Lili Taylor is such a great actress and she really looked like a possessed woman. I just can\\'t believe that Wan directed this flick, most of his previous movies are quite average; but this one, it\\'s a total blast. The Conjuring is an extremely well done horror film that has an impressive camera work, a great cast and lots of memorable scares. It definitely earns its R rating because it\\'s very gruesome and evil at times. It\\'s my favorite horror film of 2013. Oh, and please don\\'t watch the trailer, it\\'s a huge spoiler.

But what got me more excited and surprised, is that The Conjuring have such high positive reviews, higher than the average good horror movie. So when watching it, I can really see why. The Conjuring is one of the scariest films I have ever seen since Insidious. The movie gets started with the opening credits that gets a jolt out of me. Then it gets to the family, the family is interesting, while having a great balance with the Warren family. The acting is really great, especially the kid actors. It is a haunted house movie, but it's done masterfully well. I was worried that Carey and Chad Hayes were writing this as they wrote other horror films that critics didn't like, but this was well written too, and it's got smart moments in it. The scares are really effective, and it's got an amazing and exciting climax. It has a skeptic character in it which I always hate, but they don't focus on it that much, it makes sense for that character to be skeptic, and when something happens, the character really believes it. It's got some great makeup, funny moments, and great practical effects that they were definitely trying not to make it CG. I got really interested in the movie, and when the Warren family talks about demon stuff.

Just as good as the original Japanese version", "What started an onslaught of crappy J-horror remakes is actually itself a pretty damn good remake. In fact, it's arguably better than the original. It follows the story of the original pretty much beat for beat, and there are even a couple of scenes that are virtually shot-for-shot re-enactments of scenes from the original. Where it excels over the original is taking ideas from the original and going further with them. As much as I love the original, it is very much a product of its culture and some of the ideas and twist are not very clear (and they get even more convoluted if you start going into the sequels/prequels). Here the film really goes full force with the visuals available to provide a film that is first of all absolutely gorgeous in its grotesqueness, but also adds clarity and heartbreak to its mystery. I'm not saying I need a story spoon-fed to me, I like a little mystery, but the Japanese Ring gives virtually nothing to go on, and unless you're the characters in the film the mystery is pretty hard to solve. I love the idea of a horror film being part detective story, but it wasn't utilized as well as it could have been in the original. In this one, I feel like you could figure out the mystery along with them. That does lead to one of the films problems though, which is that if you've seen the original, there's not a lot of reason to see this one. It hits each of the beats so specifically that there isn't really anything new aside from the visuals, which while brilliant, aren't really enough to give a whole new experience. Still, if you've never seen The Ring, and are trying to choose whether to watch the U.S. or Japanese version, I'd honestly go with this one.", "Fell asleep, not really a \"WOW\" movie", "Didn't really scary but most interesting movie i have ever seen!!!

However, 'The Ring' alone makes the most of its creepy visuals, interesting idea, and strong cast to put it a level above the rest in a crowded (and often weak) genre. And (spoiler!) it has a relatively positive ending, which is again rare... albeit a slightly unsatisfying one to end the film. All in all, it is not the strongest horror film in recent history, though is likely to please genre fans, especially if more slow building horrors.

That being said, it has a plethora of issues (too many to cover in this review) and my biggest gripe of all SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT is the reveal of Samara's face.

The progression is flawless, good ideas pile up, making you want more and dragging you in.", "Jap version is better", "Solid remake, I actually put it on the same level as the original.

I loved this one from the first time viewing, all the way up to this recent revisit.  Gore Verbinski nicely 'Americanizes' the original Japanese story and gives us some truly unsettling moments in this story of a haunted video tape that promises death seven days after it is viewed. Hell, in our digital age, it's almost quaint to see folks worrying over a VHS cassette.  Highly recommended.", "Verbinski thrills with a surprising lack of gore or jumps but with atmosphere and tone.  Grade: B-", "The Ring is highly Americanized from the original Ringu, but offers an extremely unsettling experience mixed with an interesting investigation story that sees Naomi Watts at the top of her game.", "Pretty damn good movie, if course it's horror not the best genre but still good, I have to say I really found this movie terrific to watch there is a lot of reasons why.", "its just not scary or creepy its all over a good movie,but it has a good storyline and the actors were just made to fit these rolls it was just like it actually happend to them it seems so real", "An unsettling and uncomfortable film. While I'm not a huge fan of the film, It does have some genuinely creepy imagery (I'd say the imagery is the strongest aspect of this film) and the story is interesting enough to keep you watching all the way till the end. Not my favorite horror film, but if you have yet to see it then it's worth a rental, maybe a purchase because it IS a classic horror film and it jump-started the Japanese inspired horror craze.", "Let's face it, horror films are always going to get remakes. There is no way around that statement, because whether it was made in a foreign country and praised, or frankly just made as an American film 10 or 20 years ago, studios will always want to rejuvenate what made them buckets of cash in the past. There are cases like Blair Witch, where it was practically hated by everyone and was completely unnecessary, and then there are instances like Let Me In, where it does nothing to diminish the original, but its sole mission is just to bring its story over to another language and display a great story for a wider audience. That is exactly how I feel The Ring was handled back in the day, and still remains to be one of the better horror remakes.  What makes these remakes less special, will always be their need to follow the original beat for beat. Yes, this film was pretty much just a translation from the Japanese version, but when it begins and ends almost in replication, it can be a little predictable for viewers who have seen the original. Once again following a woman who has watched a video tape and receives a phone calling telling her that she will die in seven days, a mystery begins to unfold about whether or not it's true. There are certain additions that I thought added some terrific tension, specifically the fact that the drawings aspect was handled in much more detail here. Sadly, almost every enjoyable aspect of this film has already been done before.  While I will defend this film for being extremely effective and will defend anyone who calls this their favourite horror film, the portions that are meant to frighten audiences, are done in a way that is not quite as scary as the Japanese film, Ringu. The close-ups done in that film, relying solely on what could be done to the human body in order to terrify people, was truly scary. This time around, prosthetics are used on everyone and it took away from something that I found to be scarier in the past. Having said all that, the cinematography, along with the prosthetics and top-notch effects for its time, really does make this a worthy remake.  When this film was released back in 2002, Naomi Watts barrelled onto the big screen, all guns blazing. Her shrieks and frightening faces truly made you feel as though you were watching someone go through these horrible events. I think they casted the perfect person to portray the leading lady here. I may not be a hug fan of horror films, but I can certainly recognize when they are done with class. The Ring casts the right talent to play off of each other, so that when the terror does happen, it feels genuine. Like Ringu, everyone on-screen seems to be giving their all and truly caring about the characters they are portraying.  In the end, all this film really needs to do is tell the story of Ringu in a classy way that would bring in a new audience and please fans of that original film as well. Personally, The Ring does just that and really does make for a creepy film overall. Not comparing this to the film that proceeded it, this film truly is something special for the horror genre. Instead of slashing up people in the woods or playing mind games with someone, The Ring takes its time to build tension so that you feel the payoff works in the final act. I love the original, so due to the fact that it is a little too similar to the original and doesn't try enough new things, I can call this a very solid film. Yes, I feel the same way about films like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Still a great film on its own, but it wouldn't exist without the original.", "The way this Film is directed makes you feel cold and disturbed. Yes, it is a little confusing, but for me (and maybe some other people too) It made Perfect sense at the end. I have no flaws at all.

The story follows a journalist, who watched a mysterious videotape and learns that she will die exactly seven days later, in her quest to find out the truth about the persons in the VHS tape. Creepy ghostlike women, old houses and water in a dark surrounding are often the main source of spookiness in these Japanese themed horror movies. The inevitable sequel followed in 2005.

The relationship between the characters is almost nonexistant, you're given no indication of any connection between Rachel and her son other than she's his mother.

The audience has no idea of the source of the horror (which only manifests itself, fleetingly, twice during the entire running-time) for the vast majority of the film, and has no avenues to speculate on, because it takes practically the whole length of the feature for the main character to piece the puzzle together. This dilutes any identification that might have been had with the characters or any scariness that might have otherwise been felt if we had only been given a taste of actual horror during the first hour and a half, as opposed to being forced to sit through to a largely unsatisfactory final act.

I\\'m still not entirely sure how I feel about this movie as a whole because some aspects I liked, while others not so much. I\\'ll start with the things that I enjoyed. First off, the music. Hans Zimmer created an awesome score for this film and it fits the mood perfectly throughout the entire film. Not only was it memorable but it resonated well with visuals. I also enjoyed the special effects. Even though there were a few scenes where the CGI looked rather fake most of it however did not, and I was pleasantly surprised to see some practical effects used as well.The cinematography was also done really well and I enjoyed the filters they chose to use on the cameras. Every shot had an ominous presence about it. Even during the day it still felt dark and cold, which was a nice touch. I also felt that the director (Gore Verbinski) did a great job with the camera shots and the use of locations he had to work with. A lot of the scenes wouldn\\'t have been nearly as scary or as tense if it weren\\'t for the decision he made, so props to him.   However, there were also a few elements to this film which could have been done just a little better in my opinion. Firstly, the acting. Naomi Watts is the only actor in this entire film that I actually cared about and believed. The rest of the cast just seemed mediocre at best. And I can\\'t blame the actors too much because they really didn\\'t have much to work with. Which leads me to my next problem, the script. If the script was better written it would have made the movie just that much more enjoyable. There were a few scenes where the dialogue just seemed really awkward and out of place and even though those scenes were seldom, it was enough to make you realize that \"Oh, I\\'m watching a movie right now.\" which is never good sign.

Frankenstein (1931)", "95%, Scary, Good Acting. Very Original.", "Though not without great qualities, this is one of the most overrated, over-hyped, foolish, films ever made. The screenplay is disjointed, hacked up, and an embarrasing Oscar win.   Things are simply placed there for us to be shocked by, for effect, with no real purpose. What is the purpose behind an anonymous priest finding a desecrated statue in a church? Where does that take us story-wise? It is only there as for effect. What purpose does the whole opening scene in Iraq serve? The old priest we meet later on finds a little statue thought to reoresent evil...ok...whatever.  Noises in the attic which sound nothing like rats, are thought to be rats. Where does that lead? The house has spirits in it that will end up being Satan in Regan? Ok, but thats a really forced explanation. They are only another pointless effect as you walk through a spook house.  At the party, how does Burstyn's character know this priest who loves sing alongs? Why would he be there other than the script needs a priest involved?   The entire storyline with Lee J. Cobb's detective is pointless and could be cut.   Regan has one incident of urinating and what anyone would dismiss as a child's bad dream moment, we are told she's 'been sick'. Really? We saw no lead up to this, indicating she is sick. Then we quickly jump to her screaming at the doctor's office and discussion about neuro electrical problems. Huh? Again, no build up or narrative to this moment.  What exactly is the physiological reason for throwing up green slime? What is it? How exactly does a human head spin around without the neck breaking? I know, we are just supposed to be scared by another pointless effect.  Linda Blair does not give a performance as one is not needed. She is merely a prop for the director and effects guys.   At least they had the sense to cut 'the spiderwalk'. What purpose would that serve to advance the story? Other than another 'BOO' moment in the spook house? And why would Satan have Regan do this? Or make her bed bump around? Or anything that happens? It's just for show.  Editing and sound problems exist all over. Burke is undeveloped in the first place and when we hear of his death, the scene is cut short. At no point does the sound of Satan's voice appear to be coming from Regan's mouth. They did not even manage to have Blair's mouthing the words match what Mercedes McCambidge is saying as Satan.  Thankfully at that year's Oscar's, a truly entertaining, well constructed film won. What intelligent film fan would not rather watch The Sting or American Graffiti for the 100th time, than The Exorcist for the 2nd time?  On the positive side, Burstyn is great, and the storyline about Fr Karras and his mother is truly moving. But on the whole, it was hyped, empty and silly then, and still is.", "Best horror movie ever, i really love the story and acting performances, ive seen it over 50 times, plus great music and makeup effects, it really makes you wonder that anybody could become possessed", "Rating: 93% Featuring a haunting performance from Linda Blair and some appropriately frightening scares, The Exorcist succeeds not only as a supernatural horror but as a suspenseful drama as well.", "The Exorcist bolds it's revolutionary effects and performances from Linda Blair's Possessed Regan to Ellen Burstyn's Tormented Chris in one of the biggest game-changers of it's time", "The only movie that made me spooked out.

Whether it is the fascinating and scary story or the awesome acting, this movie is great.", "I was probably only nine or eleven when I first saw this film and couldn't watch it in its entirety. It was far beyond scary at the time and extremely disturbing. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be an everlasting movie; most people today can view it without any problems.    The performances by the people who played the priests were right on, Burstyn didn't really have to act so much as to provide a performance of any kind; Friedkin took care of that, and Linda Blair was just a beautiful kid turned exceedingly devilish.    I'm not sure if it was the makeup, the well written screenplay or the profanity, but one thing is for certain; an experience was created to have people remembering, panicking and even dying from its jolt of terror that had a paranormal activity coming to a near quota.", "William Friedkin's masterpiece is every bit as harrowing today as it was over 40 years ago. Linda Blair plays an impressionable 12 year old who becomes possessed by an ancient and very powerful demon named Pazuzu. Ellen Burstyn is her hard-living middle-aged actress mother and Jason Blair is a trouble priest who attempts to find someone worthy of exorcising her. Max von Sydow comes to the rescue and the events that unfold hurl at you in rapid pace. The horror does not lie in suspense but rather in thinking. The further the film delves into Catholic fundamentals of demonic possession the more enrapturing the film becomes. Stellar performances by Burstyn, Blair, and Miller add to the horrific delight of this acclaimed gem.", "it was sckry it hade good ackts and acktors", "Very suspenseful and incredibly well acted, I especially enjoyed Jason Miller. There is some really good practical effects in here, especially the infamous head turning scene. The final act was really suspenseful, although essentially anticlimactic in the end.

But, that is MY opinion.", "The plot is fine, the acting is fine, very scary, the swearing and blood can seem a bit much at times though.", "A visual and audio funhouse that just so happened to prey upon our most hardwired superstitions. We take for granted today the shocking and life-threatening scare tactics director William Friedkin innovated. Even without the visual effects, the unhinged performances by the cast resulted in a truly terrifying experience - at least for the first time you watch it. Gradually, as you watch lesser caliber horror, the violent nature of the film mitigates. But with its carefully orchestrated silences and assaults on the viewer, nothing compares to this. Watch it only once, when you're still open-minded as to the concepts of evil spirits.   Pazuzu floated head-circles around other invisible villains like Keyser Soze and the mad truck driver from Duel. This nasty demon even surpasses other non-human terrors such as Jaws and the Borg Queen because of its blatantly malicious intent. Whereas we can debate the evil heart of the monster in Cloverfield or Godzilla (which theoretically could be a worried mommy looking for her eggs) Pazuzu's evil lust is insatiable. This King of the demons was not content until it has possessed and violated a 12-year old girl, swore like a sailor, defied all human logic with its ghostly bag of tricks and wasted not one but two priests. That's what you call a devil's advocate.", "Best movie ever made. Period.", "I'm just gonna start off by saying if you haven't seen The Exorcist, you are not a true horror fan.

The Exorcist has great performances, eerie direction from William Friedkin, and well-paced, effective character development. I've never seen a movie that has matched the horror that this movie displayed. It scares you because it gets in your head and under your skin and it sticks with you for awhile after you watch it, unlike most horror movies today where they try to scare you with loud startling noises.

What I want to say that is often overlooked is the acting of this film. This is really a drama. I mean Ellen Burstyn who plays the mother of the possessed girl, did an amazing job, I mean I really felt for her. And Linda Blair, who plays Reagan, can you imagine, being a 12 year old girl and having to swear like that! God, what a commitment.

What sets The Exorcist apart is that it preys on our spiritual fears - our internal conflicts; doubts, regrets, guilt - and our emotional fears; fear of loss, fear of uncertainty, fear of the unknown.

The scenes that don't involve Linda Blair or exorcisms fall so flat on their faces, that they're enough to put people to sleep. It's a plot that simply isn't engaging, suffering from a large portion of side characters who are not interesting to be around with. Scenes involving Blair's possessed character do provide memorable moments that one will never forget; but is it enough to warrant multiple viewings of the film?

But, is it still good, even more than 40 years later? When the movie mas made, back in 1973, it was considered the scariest movie ever made. I, personally, wouldn't call this movie to be the scariest now. There are a lot of creepy scenes that made me feel a bit uneasy, but it was never truly terrifying. Despite it not being very scary in this modern time, it's still a brilliant movie. The story is quite basic. A girl is possessed by a demon, who claims to be the devil himself, and we slowly see how she falls more and more under the control of the demon. Her mother takes her to a lot of doctors, but there never seems to be any problems with her brain or any other organs. After so many doctors and psychiatrists, she becomes desperate and asks a priest for help, to do an exorcism on her. The story isn't anything special or remarkable, but back when this movie was made, it was all still uncharted territory. The characters are well developed and I especially liked Damien Karras, the priest who does the exorcism (with the help of another, of course). The special effects look great, even now. There's a lot of practical effects and it's really amazing how they managed to do so much with the technology they had back then. The whole exorcism scene at the end is breathtaking. It lasts for quite long and ends on a very depressing, emotional note. The acting was great, except the girl, who at some scenes was very cringey, but it all changes when she becomes possessed. The direction of the movie is also great, I don't have any complaints about it. I actually don't have any complaints about this movie at all. It's a remarkable achievement in the horror genre and there probably won't be anything else quite like it. I would highly recommend checking this movie out, even if you're not a horror fan. This is, just like The Godfather, a must-see.", "Greatly directed, masterfully acted, and great suspense make this one of the best horror films of all-time; for the time (1973), it was ahead of its time, making it one of the most timeless horror films to graze the screen.", "One of the best horror / suspense films of all time and is culturally significant. Initial Hollywood viewings required personnel to revive viewers with smelling-salts from passing-out due to fear (seriously).", "Seminal horror film.

The exorcism scene is devilishly awesome.This was a breakthrough film in its day and still delivers the frights today.", "Holds up very well and actually scary.", "Best horror film of all time...period.", "Great movie, didn't find it too scary though. But story, writing, acting and such was solid.", "The Exorcist (1973) was never expected to become the classic that it is today. With an estimated budget of $10,497,444, Director William Friedkin mortified and disturbed teens and adults so severely that The Exorcist is known as the \"scariest movie ever made\". The version of this movie that I viewed is the Director\\'s cut; this version does not omit anything, it is actually longer than the originally released one. The Director\\'s Cut is William Friedkin\\'s original finished work, but because of the graphic nature of the Director\\'s Cut, some scenes were cut to be more suitable for movie theater viewing. The original and current Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) in the United States is R for its strong language and disturbing images.   The Exorcist takes place in Georgetown in the current day of the movie\\'s release (1973). The movie follows the life of a twelve-year-old girl, Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), during the duration of her possession by an evil demon that claims to be the Devil. The opening scene of the movie takes place in Iraq at an archaeological site where Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) is working; during this scene a figurine is found that you see throughout the whole movie and seems to have ties to Regan\\'s possession. You are then introduced to Regan and her Mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn). Regan\\'s Mother is an actress; she and Regan had just moved to Georgetown in Washington D.C. for the movie Chris was starring in. During this introduction Regan is a completely normal twelve-year-old girl who is excited about a horse she had seen that day and loves crafts; but Chris finds an Ouija board in the basement that Regan claims to use to talk to a ghost named \"Captain Howdy\".  As the movie progresses strange things begin happening in the house, like banging sounds in the attic and the window in Regan\\'s room being open, making the room freezing cold. After an incident where Regan\\'s bed begins shaking her personality begins to completely change. Chris takes her to the doctor where they believe that she just needs to take a medication, Adderall, and she will soon be better. After a scan of her brain they find that there aren\\'t any abnormalities which make her behavior much less explainable. The possession really takes hold of Regan after the scans. The possession of Regan results in the death of three characters and multiple scenes that contain an overwhelming amount of profanity, sexual references and innuendoes, and violence that all come from 12-year-old Regan.  Although The Exorcist was released in 1973, it displays excellent use of special effects. The face of a demon that appears in some places is used frequently; the demons face is always just an overlay on the film rather than an actor that is actually being filmed with the scene. They also sometimes overlay photos of the figurine found in the archeological site. Some other advanced and convincing effects used were making Regan\\'s bed shake, making her head spin around, violent thrashing, cuts that are caused by holy water being thrown as if it was a whip, and projectile vomiting. Sound is something used very often to achieve different effects. Music played always matches the type of scene. For example, suspenseful music is played during suspenseful scenes. The iconic Exorcist theme song, Tubular Bells, is played right before some of the strange things with Regan happen while Chris is walking home. They also make sounds louder to put emphasis on things. During a scene where Father Merrin is going to leave Iraq, the sounds of traffic and working people is amplified as well as the sounds of dogs fighting when he looks at a larger version of the evil figurine that was found. You also see this in a scene where Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller) is going to visit his Mother, in a city neighborhood that isn\\'t as well off as the other neighborhoods you see in the movie, any sounds that are negative like a woman yelling or children jumping on a car are very loud in comparison to other sounds in the scene. Another interesting use of sound is the many voices that Regan has when she is possessed. She takes on the voice of the demon (Mercedes McCambridge) as well as some other voices, one of which is the voice of Father Damian\\'s Mother (Vasiliki Maliaros); these voices are added seamlessly and match up with Regan\\'s mouth movements very well.  Lighting is something else that was used a lot (and well) to create different atmospheric effects. In Iraq most of the lighting that was prominent was from the sunrise and sunset. The sun would always be very bright yellow on a very red sky. Most lighting in the movie is created just by the regular light of the room, like a lamp or harsh fluorescent lighting. The makeup used is very convincing. The longer Regan is possessed, the less human she begins to look; this effect is accomplished by first making her become pale with very dry and cracking lips, and then by progressively creating the look of sores, cuts, and bruises all over her. They also successfully created a false stomach over Regan\\'s real stomach that had very pronounced ribs and the words \"Help me\" that appeared to have been written from inside her stomach. There wasn\\'t any makeup that wasn\\'t perfectly executed. The actors in The Exorcist performed very well. Everyone does an excellent job expressing the emotions that you imagine someone would feel in the situation that they are in. I am especially impressed with Linda Blair\\'s performance, she was very young when she portrayed the possessed main character of this movie, she had to take on multiple personalities for her character and she did so flawlessly. There wasn\\'t any acting in the movie that I can think of a complaint for.  Some people may argue that The Exorcist isn\\'t really the \"scariest movie ever made\" or that it really isn\\'t as good as I think it is; most of this is due to the age of the movie. Many people see the special effects in The Exorcist as cheesy and therefore the movie as not scary. When I see The Exorcist I see amazing effects for its time and an incredibly scary movie psychologically. Overall it is hard to argue that The Exorcist is not a great movie. Of all the horror movies that have been made, The Exorcist has to be one of the most classic and most compelling of them all.", "The scariest movie ever made.

The only criticisms I had for the movie is that I found it started off a little slow. While never bad or terribly boring, it took almost 45 minutes for it to really start to get good. Now this may not be as much of a problem in the theatrical cut, which I wanted to watch but was unfortunately unavailable to me, but in this version of the film it took a while to really get going. Many people think that The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time, and it came out and even through the rest of the 70s and the 80s I don't doubt that it was. But most horror movies to come out pre-90s don't hold up as being as scary as they once may of been, and while The Exorcist holds up better than most, and still is at times a creepy movie, I didn't find it held up well enough to still be considered the scariest of all time.", "first time i've ever seen the directors cut of this movie.

Overall, this films pieces fit together forming a horror masterpiece that lives on in pop culture and spawning many sequels, prequels and copycats.", "Best Horror Movie Of All Time!!!!!", "Supernatural horror is an often exploited sub-genre in horror cinema; we've seen films like The Devil Inside and The Possession all but tarnish the idea of a spirit or demon infesting the body and soul of an individual. One of very few films that came close to perfection stretches back to 1973; The Exorcist is a relentlessly frightening film, one which continues to haunt audience to this day. The reason why is down to many things.  Based on the book of the same name by William Peter Blatty (who also adapted the story for film), The Exorcist tells the story of a 12-year-old girl named Reagan (Linda Blair) and her mother Chris Macneil (Ellen Burstyn). The innocent Reagan begins to act strangely, which gradually grows more and more severe in the film's first act. Medical and scientific methods prove ineffective in fixing Reagan as her body begins to change despite appearing normal from doctor reports. Before long a sinister force takes hold of Reagan completely, yelling obscenities in a foul voice, committing frightful acts of violence and making objects move by will alone. The doctors direct Chris to the Catholic Church and the possibility of an exorcism and from there, it's nothing but sheer scares and a serious creep factor broken up by scenes that take place outside the Macneil household. Cutting between several different locations, we learn more about the three main characters whilst also journeying through the slow growth of Reagan's possession. The horror tropes are ones which have been adopted (and in other cases ripped off) by countless other supernatural horror films in the decades since, but The Exorcist is perhaps the only one to make them feel real, not to mention translating them into true horror; the degeneration of Reagan combined with the escalating supernatural elements grabs the audience by the throat and never lets go. It seamlessly maintains the scares, as opposed to other modern horror films. Simply put, you will constantly dread what will come next every time the characters enter into the upstairs room.  Most horror films feature fairly basic characters which lack depth, but those portrayed in The Exorcist are highly realised and detailed in the emotions they convey. The bond between Reagan and her mother is very believable; it's built up over the film's first act to great effect and we see the love they share for each other before the possession begins. It's a great build-up which makes Ellen Burstyn's performance of an intensely stressed and helpless mother that much more realised and sincere. Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller) has a very deep and underlying theme to his character; he's having trouble with his faith whilst dealing with his dying mother and the way he deals with the possession makes him question his beliefs even further. It's a great display of internal conflict and the many times he is on screen before attending to Reagan allows him to develop greatly. Reagan is played by Linda Blair and Mercedes McCambridge with the film juxtaposing the voices to show a clear and often shocking difference between the innocent young girl and the sadistic demon. It's a curious creation indeed; you will believe that the voice coming out of Reagan is not from this world and that only adds to the fear the film instils into its audience. The one weak link in an otherwise stellar cast is Lee J. Cobb as the police lieutenant. When every other cast member puts so much into the film, he comes off as fairly underdeveloped and he could have had a larger role to play in the proceedings.  Perhaps the most critical aspect of the Exorcist that has terrified thousands of viewers lies with its special effects. Some of the most disturbing sights ever put to film were achieved with the work the filmmakers put into both atmosphere and puppet work. At the centre of the film is the Reagan puppet in the film's third act, a truly hideous and frightful sight; scars and moles sprout on Reagan's distinctively grey face, her head twists around in a full circle and a vile mucus erupts from her mouth. Just as Reagan's mother is horrified at her daughter's transformation, so too is the audience. Reagan's room itself is laced with an air of constant anxiety and a grim atmosphere that is only enhanced with the cold air and eerie rumbling of the bed and other surrounding objects. You really do feel that a demonic presence has enveloped the room completely. The main piano theme that sweeps in at key moments is iconic for a reason; it has such a sense of foreboding to it, informing the audience that something terrible is about to happen. The demonic presence is enhanced even further with the shadowy lighting and silhouettes that sweep the proceedings. Every single aspect of the special effects in The Exorcist pulls every ounce of their weight to pull the audience in, something which modern horror films have almost completely forgotten about.  The Exorcist more than holds up today; the impact it had on the horror genre is something I can't put into words in this review. The thematic ideas, superb acting and disturbing special effects hold its place at the top of supernatural terror. Is it the scariest movie of all time as some people say? That's debatable, but nevertheless it's still a thoroughly creepy piece of cinema that continues to mark its mark on everyone who puts themselves through it.", "Deep, dark, and frightening.

Bolstered by its strong acting, and wonderful direction.", "I appreciate what this film did for the horror genre but it just takes too long to get started the first hour of the movie is spent doing nothing the rest however is definitely worth admission", "Is The Exorcist scary because it's scary, or because Warner Bros., the studio that released it, keeps telling us over and over that it's 'the scariest movie of all time?' Well, like any film dubbed 'horror,' what's scary to one might not be to another. I think it's impossible to name any one movie the 'scariest of all time' because there's so many varying opinions of just what is scary in film that it would ultimately be a pointless argument. But movie studios know how to market their films. Warner Bros. has been doing it since 1903. That's 117 years of telling people what they want to see, nay, what they have to see, and why. So by 1973 they had gotten pretty good at it. Then the movie came out and almost instantly became one of the most profitable movies of all time. Then stories of people fainting, vomiting, going into convulsions, having miscarriages and running, running for the exits at screenings of the film around the world. I can just see the back patting, hand shaking and big fat cigar lighting going on at the Warner Bros. studios head offices when those stories came down the pike.  So what does all this mean? How is this relevant to the modern day movie watcher who pops The Exorcist into their respective movie projection device? It means you go into this movie like I did the first time I saw it; with the expectation to be scared out of your wits. With an elevated heart rate. If you're a believer, as I am, you might wonder if by simply watching this movie at all, you're committing some kind of sin. I mean, who can forget the now infamous proclamation by Mr. Billy Graham after viewing it that the film itself was pure evil and the devil's handiwork?  So does the film deliver on its promise of pure terror? In a word, yes. The first time I saw it, I was 16 or 17 and it scared the crap out of me. Some of the images stayed with me and disturbed me until just this week, when I decided to give it another go and see if it had the same effect on me a decade later. I can't say I was as scared this time as I was when I was younger, (in researching some backstory on the film recently I came across an article that said according to a poll that was taken, the film is most disturbing and scary to teenagers between the ages of 15 and 17. Weird) but it still has a powerful force in it to move and shake me at times. I'm not talking about any kind of spiritual force, and I don't agree with Billy that the film itself is evil or from the devil, I'm talking about the force that all exceedingly well made films have. That magic that plugs into our emotions and dictates the way we will feel for the next 120 minutes or so. It's that force I find so addictive in movies and what has fed my obsession with them almost my whole life. That being said, The Exorcist isn't a movie I will return to over and over again. Once or twice a decade is probably more than enough for me.  I find demon possession movies to be some of the scariest movies out there. The Exorcist sparked a whole horror film sub-genre of exorcism movies that are all disturbing in their own way and more often than not genuinely frightening experiences. But The Exorcist is still the best among them (of the ones I've seen). That's not to say the scariest (that title would probably go to last year's Paranormal Activity), but the most effective, well made and highest quality.  One aspect of that quality is the acting. How Linda Blair, a sweet, funny 13 year old girl was able to pull off the performance she did as convincingly as she did will always be one of the highlights of film history. That she didn't receive an Oscar for that performance will always be one of the biggest jokes in film history. And her amazing work was surrounded by flawless performances from Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn. This was director William Friedkin's next film after his previous, The French Connection, had won about every Oscar there was to win two years earlier and is one of the best films of all time, making for one of the best one-two punches in cinema's illustrious cannon. The direction and special effects in this movie are masterful and gave us one of the greatest screen images of all time (the one which now graces the DVD and Blu-Ray covers of the movie) of Max Von Sydow's priest standing below the possessed girl's window in front of her house, an ironic shaft of light bursting from it, seemingly inviting him into the chaos. Probably the most effective shot in the whole film. The movie doesn't directly explain why Reagan is possessed in the first place, although we see her messing with a Ouija board early on and telling her mother about her friend Captain Howdy, who she uses it to talk to. How's that for family board game night?  There are three versions of The Exorcist out there now. According to many critics, like Roger Ebert, the best version is the original theatrical version, which makes sense considering how effective the film seemed to be on audiences at the time. The second cut came out in 2000, and is called The Version You've Never Seen, which is actually the only version I have seen, show's how much you know Warner Bros. This version is about 8 minutes longer and features the very infamous 'spider walk' scene which I won't go into detail explaining but you can easily learn all about by googling it. This scene is one of the most disturbing in the whole film and the one image that stuck with me more than any other when I saw the film years ago. There are also a few extra demonic flashes that occur on walls and doors in the house which are also very frightening and effective little touches. And the ending's a little longer, which I've read pretty much ruins the movie for many people, attempting a more happy ending over the bleakness of the original. But it's the only ending I've seen so it didn't ruin anything for me. The third version is a new 'extended director's cut' which just came out with even more chills stuffed into it which I know nothing about.   The Exorcist is a strange beast. There are religious leaders (mostly protestant) who denounce the film as evil and sinful towards God. There are also religious leaders (mostly Catholic) who praise the movie for its honest and realistic depiction of demon possession and will readily recommend it to those interested in delving deeper into this subject.  I see The Exorcist as a very well made, well acted, extremely scary and disturbing experience which probably does have the most realistic portrayal of Satan on film thus far, which means this isn't a film for people who don't wish to be offended, because it will, or are easily rattled or spiritually fragile.   Then again, maybe Reagan wasn't possessed, maybe it was all just PMS. She is a teenager after all.", "I found it a classic. It was good but I found it disturbing. Of coarse if you like horror movies disturbing is good. It wasn't like any normal horror movie with jump scares or false scares and all sorts of cliches and this is what makes it original and a classic. The acting and script is also well done! If you like horror movies than the exorcist is up your alley!", "The film opens with an archaeological dig. Nothing wrong with that of course, expect that this scene is in no way whatsoever related to the rest of the entire film. There is no explanation for the scene of the archaeological dig, it is never referred to again in the rest of the film, and is therefore utterly pointless and serves only to confuse the viewer. Stanley Kubrick would have been proud.  I am told the relevance of this scene is explained in the sequel, but who makes a film and thinks \"I know, I\\'ll put a scene into the film, but it won\\'t make any sense, and I won\\'t explain it in anyway until someone else makes a sequel in four years\"? It\\'s like giving James Bond a mobile phone which also works as a lethal taser in one film, but not actually having him kill anyone with it until three films later. Idiot!  Anyway. Now we are into the film proper we are lead to believe we will see one the scariest films ever. However, it is only scary if your definition of scary is watching a twelve year old girl swear. Rather than being scary, watching Linda Blair deliver the line \"Your mother sucks **** in hell\" just made me laugh. It\\'s like watching Hit Girl say \"Ok you ****\" in Kick Ass. No one ran from the theatre screaming watching Kick Ass, no they laughed, because watching a twelve year old girl on screen swearing like a Docker is funny. But apparently because in The Exorcist she is tied to a bed vomiting mushy peas this somehow makes it scary?  The only scene which boarders on disturbing is when Regan violently masturbates with a crucifix . But the comedic element of her screaming \"Let Jesus **** you\" takes off whatever edge there may have been.  Yes, if you watched it when you were ten years old it would scare the shit out of you, or if you were eighty and had spent your life in monastery. But to an adult who lives on a housing estate and can see five year olds roaming the streets at half ten at night in the school holidays telling anyone and everyone to \"**** off\", this isn\\'t scary, isn\\'t anything special, and isn\\'t worth watching.  Maybe in 1973 it was scary, but nowadays it\\'s just mildly comical. The annoyingly pointless archaeological dig scene at the beginning, and the mountain of hype about how scary it is just leaves you annoyed. It\\'s like watching The Godfather, you come away thinking \"Was that it? What the hell does everyone bang on about it for?\"  Watch Game of Thrones instead, it\\'s scarier than this, and it\\'s got boobs in it.", "Insanely good! One of the scariest movies ever made, if not the scariest. A film every movie lover MUST see!", "It's starts slow but once in it just going it becomes a very dark intense film overall i really haven't seen to many films that can compare to its visual horror", "Best for older teens and adults only.", "Not the scariest movie of all time.", "Perhaps, seeing it today, after 40 years of imitators, makes a different effect than seeing it in 1973, but the tension created by the slow and cruel descent of Regan in hell it's still palpable. While scarier scenes have been copied many times by other movies and makes no great effect (today...) , the slow pace of the movie is unique and makes it still scary. It's the movie that every single supernatural horror movie wants to be in some way and no one manages to be, because they all want to show too much, too soon.", "The best horror movie of all time.", "Can\\'t say I\\'ve really ever understood the hype surrounding the Exorcist. Not that it\\'s a terrible movie by any stretch, but I\\'ve seen it a couple of times and to sum it up: Girl gets possessed, girl spews pea soup and obscenities, priests come in for an exorcism, priest hurls himself out the window and down the steps. The end.  Yes, I realize \"it was scary for its time\" but you could say the same for some other movies that don\\'t get near as much acclaim.   I just feel that the Exorcist relies too much on over the top shock/disgust factor, with little (or not enough) substance beneath the revulsion. An otherwise dull affair that still manages to be effectively creepy with some scary imagery, but that\\'s about it for me.  Sorry, I know my review is blasphemy in most horror circles, but this is definitely not my thing. I don\\'t see how it should be #1 on practically every \"greatest horror films of all time\" lists that I see.  But, feel free to judge for yourselves, because many other people obviously disagree with me.", "The Exorcist is a truly haunting and scary film, even if it lags at some points. The possessed girl is terrifying and the tension that leads up to the climax was exhilarating.", "I revisited this early seventies horror. The most controversial and thought provoking in the genre at the time. William Friedkin directed the film from a 1971 book of the same name by William Peter Blatty. The film features some extreme language and special effects for the time. Probably a template for later films in the horror genre in Hollywood anyway. I've seen plenty of Italian giallo films from before 1973 that were just as extreme. The film was a victim of censors cuts upon release in the UK and was only broadcast on terrestrial television in 2001! The Catholic Church and the subject of demons taking over a 12 year old child are the main subject matter. Conventional psychiatry fails to solve the problem and it is left to an old fashioned Catholic exorcism. If it was made in the modern era the film would probably have less or little shock value it is partly the era it was made in. The cinema grosses prove this. It was financially successful. The film certainly did not shock me like many other viewers felt.", "Exorcising Faith?:  The Exorcist is widely considered to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time, and after watching this legendary film, it\\'s easy to see why. For starters, this movie actually has a plot, which is a rarity in horror. The characters grow and develop: A depressed Father Karras(Jason Miller) is shown questioning his faith and sharing a drink with a fellow priest over his mother\\'s poor health; Regan is shown as innocent before the possession, and her deterioration is slow and steady; Chris\\'s feelings toward Regan change throughout the film, leading to famous her line, \"That thing upstairs is not my daughter.\" By forming a relationship between the characters and audience, The Exorcist allows true horror and suspense to be felt on behalf of the characters; rather than watching a bunch of people you don\\'t know/care about get systematically murdered onscreen (I\\'m looking at you, Leo Gabriadze\\'s Unfriended). Each death in the movie is meaningful to the story and evokes emotion from the audience. The characters and even the plot seem to deny the possibility of a possession, which is only accepted after exhausting every somatic and psychological possibility. This makes the tension build to the climax of \"Good vs. Evil\" even more satisfying. Contemporary viewers will be surprised at the quality of the special effects, despite the lack of CGI. The special effects makeup alone is far better than any modern horror I\\'ve ever seen, from the ability to make Regan look progressively sicker throughout the course of the movie, the projectile vomiting, to the famous 180 ? head spin.   WARNING: THE NEXT PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS!  One of the other great things about this film is its interesting portrayal of religion. Father Karras himself doesn\\'t believe an exorcism will do anything; he tries to disprove the possibility of a possession multiple times. Karras is also shown questioning his faith, and struggling with guilt over his mother\\'s death; establishing the humanity of the priest. He\\'s not any different from a normal person, there\\'s an absence of the holier-than-thou attitude. The film portrays the Catholic Church not as a truth, but rather what it really is: an organization. Catholicism, though specifically portrayed in the film, is a metaphor for not just Christianity, but organized religion as a whole, and the exorcism could be considered a metaphor for the practices of those religions.  No matter what way you look at it, The Exorcist is a truly phenomenal film. This movie, while not conventionally what we consider horror to be today, definitely stands out. It\\'s still just as shocking and suspenseful as the year it was released, and it still crosses a few lines today. It\\'s not hard to see why people often call it the greatest horror movie ever, it has a universal sense of appeal, and moreover, it actually tells a story filled to the brim with suspense, action, and emotion.", "Horror movies are better when they play beach volleyball with our emotional capacity, and \"The Exorcist,\" one of the best of its kind, is a visceral experience, to say the least. It is horrifying, disturbing, and ugly, but it is also insightful, smart, and as realistic a film as supernatural as one like this can be. It details, based on the title alone, an exorcism, but it is unique in that is (1) among the first in its subgenre, and (2) a great deal more careful in examining the emotional toll the traumatic sequence of events has on those involved. Arguably, it is more impactful post-viewing, when we\\'re lying in bed at midnights, alone with our thoughts - it is as though we were there, trapped in 1973, acting as a part of the group of people touched by the possession of Linda Blair\\'s Regan. It grabs us, becomes a part of us, with more doggedness that we\\'re comfortable to admit.  The film is an adaptation of William Peter Blatty\\'s huge-for-its-time 1971 novel of the same name, which was, in turn, inspired by the real-life exorcism of Roland Doe, a 1940s farm boy whose name has still not been released to the public. It is the stuff of nightmares, sinister, shaking, and jarringly authentic.  Over the years, film has taught us to be afraid of crazed killers and criminals, but rarely do our fears come directly from the uncharted territories of Heaven and Hell, which, no matter your religion, are frightening places the more you consider them. While we have the ability to maintain some sort of control of monsters that roam the streets, we don\\'t have a direct upper-hand to God or the Devil - I dare you to toy with a Ouija board after viewing \"The Exorcist\" and see if you\\'d rather play it safe than tease an embodied evil.  The evil portrayed in \"The Exorcist,\" unapproachable, unknowable, is scarier than contrasting controlled doers of violence in the Michael Myers sense. With the latter, you at least can see the malevolence in front of you. But in \"The Exorcist,\" the menace can slip through cracks in the floor, through doorways - you never know where it is, until it\\'s too late. This \"evil\" is a demonic entity that decides to possess the body of loving 12-year-old Regan MacNeil, the daughter of a movie star (Ellen Burstyn) whose sweet personality is frighteningly overtaken by bizarre and sick-minded behavior after a few weeks of production.  It is the result of the using of a Ouija board, but the film mentions the action with nonchalant reverence that makes its tonal qualities all the more gritty. Immediately, Regan\\'s mother, Chris, is able to tell that something is seriously wrong with her daughter, whether it be psychological or something ... else. Regular visits to the doctor coincide, tests performed left and right. It isn\\'t until almost the last act of \"The Exorcist\" that it is decided that Regan may actually be possessed, and that no medical help will be able to change her condition.  Willing to do anything to return back to the normal life they once held in their hands, Chris calls upon Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), a local priest who is still suffering from the aftermath of his mother\\'s death. Karras is skeptical (perhaps an act, as no one in their right mind is necessarily willing to perform exorcisms for a living), but after seeing Regan for himself, he is drawn to the case and invites the older Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) to aid him in his performance. Neither, however, realize the emotional and psychical fee it will pound upon them.  In terms of story, \"The Exorcist\" is largely conventional, playing like a typical Hollywood drama until things get heavier and heavier and we begin to understand that something is distinctly off-center. So many horror movies keep tension ringing in our ears long before the horror even lets itself be known, tonally establishing itself as a genre film. But no such flairs are given to \"The Exorcist\" - it feels like an event being broadcast throughout the world at the wrong time, a dark corner we would rather ignore than live through. That\\'s one of the reasons it maintains to be such a terrifying film: it reminds us over and over that demonic possession could happen to any of us, no matter if our mother is a famous actress or a homebody. There\\'s something universal in that fear.  Friedkin\\'s no-holds-barred dedication to making \"The Exorcist\" as detailed as possible is astonishing. It\\'s no wonder Friedkin was so forceful in his vision that antagonizing the cast was not off limits. Look at how closely he watches Chris\\'s emotional deterioration, how he never for a second lets us forget that Regan is possessed, not a demon herself, how he establishes Karras as a damaged soul to heighten his character to three-dimensional levels normally absent in films like this one. Scenes are as readily able to take their time as they are ready to spit in our face - despite its supernatural face, nothing about it feels fictional.   This is in part to Dick Smith\\'s special effects (extraordinary considering the limitations of the mid-1970s) and to the performances of the cast. Regan\\'s possession sends a believable shiver down the spine both due to Smith\\'s subtle and eventually horrifying account of her disintegration and to Blair\\'s masterfully nuanced performance that travels from zero to sixty without the least bit of camp. The vocal work done by veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge (as the demon himself) is particularly scary. Burstyn develops herself as a wonderful mother in the film\\'s pre-stages, her dedication to do anything to get her daughter back all the more harrowing; Miller is vulnerable and sympathetic as the priest fighting demons of his own.  So while \"The Exorcist\" is excellent, I still have inhibitions toward its many fans who claim it to be the scariest movie ever made. In truth, it\\'s a matter of preference - I like my horror to be nonsensical and nightmarish, whereas \"The Exorcist,\" while grabbing onto attributes of the latter characteristic, has a beginning, middle, and end, and therefore eliminates the prospects of letting the mind wander into darker territories following its conclusion. Even then, don\\'t be surprised if you still find yourself grappling with what you just saw days, months, years, later.", "One of the bestest movies ever!", "There was a time when having the word \"Banned\" show up in the same breath as your film title, would instantly garner its success, regardless of any physical merit, Let\\'s ask \"I Spit On Your Grave\" about that. However The Exorcist not only had people feinting, throwing up and running head first down a darkened stair case, before out the double doors, it decided to wind censors up and still have just as much, if not more effect now, than it did back upon its release. Widely known by any one who may have even had a passing interest in film, The Exorcist thrusts us into the world of possession, when 12 year old Regan begins to act out in a dangerous a vile manner, no doctor can get to the bottom of her condition. With her behavior becoming more erratic and suspect of religious belief, Regan\\'s mother takes one last chance, enlisting the help of a withered priest to exorcise her problems. Usually with dated shock and awe film making, sending yourself back to the 70\\'s, to see what all the fuss was about, can be baffling at first. Dated scares, poor acting, primitive effect work and over exposure, usually lead to some head scratching moments, as the viewer wonders why the 6 o,clock news contains more \"Shocking Images\". The Exorcist pierces through that stigma by not only being utterly terrifying, it also has fantastic acting, brilliant effects work and a story that just doesn\\'t date. Ellen Burstyn proves early on, why she\\'s one of the most under rated actresses of her generation, Miller is hypnotic as a broken priest and Max Von Sydow pulls of a brief but blistering performance as a high priest. This would all be worthless had Linda Blair not been on the ball, and although not the best child performance ever, you have to tip your hat to a young girl, in any day and age, that goes the distance with such a vulgar character. Regan is briefly built up as sweetness personified, before being torn from our grasp and turned into a sex crazed, head twisting, murderous beast and you could argue that make up, voice over work and a solid director do sell the performance, Blair cannot be faulted for her efforts, commitment and general performance of the character. Which is just as well because if you thought you had seen it all The Exorcist will ruin your eyes forever. Friedkin crafts an atmospheric and chilling piece, full of symbolism, religion and desperation, The Exorcist feels like a vivid dream, just fantastical enough, while still being utterly believable. Friedkin gives a sense of weight and purpose to not only the situation, but character itself, opting for a slow build up of tense sequences, rather than over drawn scenes. This makes the viewer alert, giving us too much to swallow whole, but not enough to choke on. The film finds its scares from a mixture of shock and down right unease, yes it could be argued that Regan may be too deplorable once her transformation begins, others would argue that her vulgarity would perfectly emulate what the almighty lord of evil would have in store for a youthful girl, rooted heavily in family. Regardless of your opinion, you cannot fault the films ability to heighten your fear of helplessness and tackle a subject, no one would dare touch, with that age of character. The Exorcist splits itself into 3, wonderfully packaged, parts, and as wonderful as it all comes together, the beginning does feel slightly over bloated. It is completely evident why the beginning has to happen as it does, however we appear to hit that nail on the head, one too many times, feeling almost like we get what Friedkin is trying to say, but not being allowed to move on. Once the ball is rolling however, its full steam ahead and The Exorcist never wavers, the inclusion of a camp detective tries to derail the entire thing, but the main cast are too busy burning your retinas. Will offend everyone but be so good at it, you cannot fail to fall in love with it.", "Yes, this is the best horror movie ever made and it\\'s almost a certainty that no other horror movie in the future will even come close. It\\'s not that Linda Blair got nominated for oscar for best actress in a supporting role in the age of 15, nor the terrifying (but at the same time a bit ridiculous) scene that she walks down stairs upside down or the head spinning scene, but the fact that director William Friedkin builds up tension agonizingly slowly. It\\'s one of those good old movies that didn\\'t hurry up revealing everything right from the start like modern movies do, trying to scare you with all possible impressive but cheap tricks. The exorcist is mainly a psychological horror film (the most succesful modern film that comes to my mind in that department is \"It Follows\"). The slow but engaging progression of the possession, the step by step lose of faith by the priest and the emotional breakdown of the poor mother all are means to the end of engaging the spectator to the realm of the film. After that the final 5-10 minutes of the movie are just the shocking end that finishes the work. Like Rocky features the fight between the hero and Apollo Creed just in the final minutes of the movie, the exorcism itself actually lasts a few minutes and it\\'s only a secondary part of the plot. All in all this one is a classic horror film that like \"Night of the Living Dead\" noone should have missed. Grade: A+", "Brilliant horror film that holds up as not only the scariest of all time but simple one of the best movies ever. The cast is superb across the board, with Ellen Burystn conveying a mother desperate to find out what's wrong with her child while Linda Blair is perfect as a normal 12 year going through a horrific experience. Max Von Sydow also brings much needed gravitas at the end as the Father Merrin, the priest who knows exactly what's happening. Behind the camera, William Friedkin brilliantly adapts William Blatty's novel by staying realistic and taking it's time. Chris &amp; Regan's family life is firmly established, and when Regan's possession starts to happen, she at first seeks medical advice (including a gruesome brain scan procedure). Even the exorcism itself is handled in a down to earth manner, with even the Catholic church being skeptical at first &amp; following protocols before approving it. All this gives a film a 'real world' horror, doubled by brilliant special effects that haven't aged a day (I still will never eat pea soup). Despite all that, there is still a nice, uplifting message about good triumphing over evil (something Blatty always intended, as he still claims he never set out to tell a horror story). Altogether, still the scariest film ever made and one of the finest ever produced.", "Perhaps the greatest horror film. Some of the effects have aged, but the craft and seriousness of its vision can still shake you. This movie feels like it's wrestling with evil, the kind that exists all around us. The performances all carry the weight of coming face to face with it.", "I was just 5 when this horror extravaganza hit theaters back in '73, so unfortunately I was unable to see it upon it's original release. But a couple of years later in '76 my mother and a neighbor went to the Winnetka Drive-In out in Chatsworth Ca., and WOW was I in for the shock/scare of my life. My mother thought that I had gone to sleep but I hadn't and what I saw has stayed with me since that night. To be quite honest as I've grown the scare factor has lessened somewhat but as a catholic and an adult with 3 girls myself what remains is a truly emotionally harrowing ride through a little girl (Regan) and her mother's horrifying ordeal with demonic possession. Max Von Sydow was perfectly cast as Father Merrin as the Exorcist of the title, as was his contemporary Father Karras (Jason Miller). My heart always bleeds for young Regan when she goes through her torment, and because of the Exorcist I have developed a lifelong distaste for the Ougia board, it was because of this board (or a least a similar facsimile to the Ougia) the Captain Howdy took possession of her body. The Exorcist has been made into many sequals and dozens of lesser imitators, but wheather you take the Exorcist to be the scariest movie or most emotionally harrowing movie of all time, it is still the best film of it's type past, present, or future, HANDS DOWN!!!!", "Timeless special effects and a sense of chilling hopelessness, The Exorcist is still a very good horror movie, one that has been undiminished by time and seems just as powerful now as it did upon its release.", "I was really hoping that The Exorcist would be an artistic, suspensful, horror masterpiece, and yet it insisted on the same boneheaded attempts to shock and annoying \"gross out\" style visuals that have constrained horror movies ever since. Its only redemption is in the top notch acting of Miller and von Sydow.", "Scared the hell out of me...and this is from 1973? Quite a handful, indeed.", "For any horror fan you will know that the exorcist is the big one, this is not only one of the most loved horror movies, it is known as the scariest horror movie of all time. Now going in I was worried I wouldn't enjoy this film and it would be overhyped. However the exorcist is a brilliant film. This film is very scary and very well done, I loved it. This film has outstanding acting, this is probably some of the best acting in a horror movie I've ever seen. Ellen Burstyn is absolutely brilliant, she's very sympathetic and gives a very good peformance. Linda Blair is a brilliant actress, she gives an amazing peformance, she's both likeable and scary as fuck and it's all through her peformance. Max von Sydow has a fairly small role but he's brilliant, I love how commanding he is and how he has this great presence. The actor who plays Damien Karass is great, he's such a broken and sympathetic yet likeable character, he's just a brilliant actor. This film is brilliantly directed by William Friedkin, he did such a good job. This film has brilliant cinematography and brilliant writing that add a lot to this great movie. The music is brilliant, there is a scene in which the mother walks home and the music makes that scene so creepy. It's one of the most iconic horror music scores ever. This film is known for being very scary and yeah it is, this film has some utterly terrifying moments. One of the scariest scenes is Damien's nightmare, it's so scary and it had me on edge. From the moment you get to the doctors scene this film becomes really really scary, there's a lot of tension that keeps you on edge. This film has a slow build up which creates even more tension as you have gotten to like these characters. This film is also full of disturbing images. The scene with the crucifix especially is very disturbing. The ending of the film is extremely creepy and very well done. This film also holds up very well considering it's over 40 years old. If I had any problems u would say the first 30 minutes aren't as good as the rest of the film but that's it. The exorcist is a brilliant film and an absolute classic. A", "Damned for its obscenity, fiercely attacked by many (including Billy Graham) for the ways it reflected that era\\'s seeming collapse of values, \"The Exorcist\" has since then been attacked as a conservative allegory: the disguised story of a rich movie star rescuing her drug-addicted daughter with the help of the church.  But \"The Exorcist,\" like most memorable Hollywood movies, gains its power from the way it mixes opposites: new-style realism and sexual radicalism, old-style horror and religion. How odd it now seems that one of the most ferociously pro-Catholic films of its era should have been attacked as anti-Catholic, or that a film so saturated with religious feeling should have been dammed as immoral and irreligious in intent. But four-letter words often offend professional moralists more than content and, thanks to Blatty, Friedkin and McCambridge, \"The Exorcist\" contains some of the most memorable obscenities in any movie.  It has much more, though. Even after almost three decades of increasing movie overkill, it\\'s a thriller that really thrills, a shocker that really shocks.

This piece of art from Friedkin should not be judged and compared to other horror movies today as that would be unfair. Particularly, this was the movie that started it all. It brought horror to life and terrified audiences when originally released. Although 'The Exorcist' was ripped off from other films today that don't even come close as to how good this masterpiece was, 'The Exorcist' remains standing tall as one of the most scarring films of all time. Famous for its brilliant acting and original subject this film set the tone for the now somewhat strong genre of horror. Remarkable film director William Friedkin should be proud of what this film accomplished. 'The Exorcist' terrified horror die-hard's and affected them psychologically and emotionally. When owning the name 'Scariest Movie of All Time' this film keeps that name and locks it in a cage. There is still no film as original, transfixing, and amazing as The Exorcist was then as to what any horror film can ever be today and in that sense 'The Exorcist' will leave its mark as an astonishing horror movie that will live on for decades.", "We all have heard the stories: People left the theaters in shock, evangelists claimed that Satan himself was in the film\ud066 celluloid, a problematic production that was believed to be cursed, some movie theaters provided barf bags, people fainted midway through, etc. But not only is \"The Exorcist\" filled with stories, but it was also the first horror film to be nominated for 10 Academy Awards (an achievement that has only been repeated once with \"The Silence of the Lambs\") and it\\'s now wildly considered the scariest film ever made. Does \"The Exorcist\" alive up to its insanely colossal reputation?  Regan MacNeil is an educated and sweat 12 year old girl that lives a happy life with her mother Chris MacNeil. But one day, she drastically changes her personality and claims that \"there\\'s some inside of her\". Desperate, Chris looks for helps in every single area devoted to the human health, but ultimately she decides to go to a more spiritual area.  When it comes to horror films, there are five films that leave an impact on my childhood, thus I have a soft-spot in my heart for them: The film that showed me that even your family is capable of committing monstrous acts (Kubrick\ud066 \"The Shining\"), the film that made me avoid the sea (Spielberg\ud066 \"Jaws\"), the film that made me afraid of an old man inside a cage (Demme\ud066 \"The Silence of the Lambs\"), and the film that showed me the versatility of science fiction (Scott\ud066 \"Alien\"). But the film that both bored me and traumatized me was the one that\\'s now considered \"the scariest film of all time\": William Friedkin\ud066 \"The Exorcist\". \"The Exorcist\" is not what you would expect from a horror film that has that kind of reputation, as it is a film that has character development, impressive and memorable dialog, a marvelously written script, complicated and relatable characters, beautiful cinematography, an iconic score (no, I\\'m not talking about \"Tubular Bells\" as it is barely used, but it still is iconic), themes that are handled in a subtle way, a masterfully crafted creepy atmosphere, impeccable acting, a little amount of warm moments, impressive special effects for its time and ones that have endure the test of time, a perfect use of ambiguity, most characters have a character arc, a pacing that\\'s all about build up, a climax that\ud066 the perfect payoff of all the tense atmosphere, a good amount of disturbing scenes that will burn into your memory, Friedkin\ud066 directing is perfectionist, precise and at times ironic; an editing that shows exactly what\\'s necessary at the precise moment, and unforgettable imagery (Who could ever forget the spider walk, the green vomit, or the rotating head?). My only issue with this film is ironically my favorite moment of it: Its climax. While it is disturbing, unforgettable, terrifying and a perfect payoff of all the build up, it also goes to unintentional comedic territory. Some of the dialog is a little excessive and out of place plus certain moment is supposed to be intense but it comes off as slapstick comedy.  \"The Exorcist\" is undeniably one of the best horror films ever made (I named \"The Silence of the Lambs\" my second favorite horror film but the more I think about it, \"The Exorcist\" deserves that title). It is shocking, disturbing, unforgettable and masterful. Even if you are not a person of faith, this is a film that needs to be seen as at least you will find it disturbing.", "Unforgettably horrifying.", "The beginning and the end were well done, the editing especially standing out.", "Whoa, this movie is wild. Has that eerie 70's, actually scary feel. Great special effects for its time.", "Excellent classic horror movie with strong performances by Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow and Jason Miller. William Friedkin did a brilliant job directing this movie and the cinematography really stood out. The soundtrack is terrifyingly good and there were a lot of moments where I was frightened by what I saw. I did have some problems with the opening scene, which felt noticeably out of place for me compared to the rest of the movie. This movie also had its share of slow moments, but definitely made up for it with the development of the story and characters. The Exorcist is definitely a movie you have to see at least once in your life. I am interested in watching the Theatrical Version sometime soon, as I watched 'The Version You've Never Seen'. This movie has such a fantastic suspense build up, I wish I saw it when I was just a kid. The make-up effects in this movie were outstanding and some of the creepy images throughout were definitely haunting. I'm more than interested in reading the book by William Peter Blatty at some point in my life.", "The greatest horror film ever made and the seminal masterpiece of it's genre, director William Friedkin's brilliant meticulously-mounted adaptation of William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel. Concerning a innocent 12-year-old girl named Regan MacNeil, played by young Linda Blair, in a remarkable film debut which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, she is possessed by the monstrous demon, Pazuzu, that causes Regan to change into a vile unspeakable being, spitting out obscenities and blasphemies as well as using telekinetic powers to hurt others. Her anguished movie star mother, Chris MacNiel, played by Ellen Burstyn, in a marvelous Oscar nominated performance, turns to a troubled young priest as a last resort, Father Damien Karras, played by the late Jason Miller, who delivers a intense and exceptionally commanding performance, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Father Karras calls upon the church to bring in an experienced priest for an exorcism, they summon an aged exorcist/ archaeologist named Father Lancaster Merrin, remarkably played by the great Swedish actor Max von Sydow, in a riveting tour-de-force performance. A battle ensues for the body and soul of young Regan that is one the most horrific and unforgettable finals in cinematic history. Masterful direction by Friedkin, with impeccable supporting performances from the late Lee J. Cobb, Kitty Wynn and the late Jack MacGowran, but its Max von Sydow who steals this motion picture with his extraordinary performance, as the aged exorcist Father Merrin. Oscar winner for Blatty's compelling intelligent screenplay, the chilling vocal effects are by Mercedes McCambridge, masterful makeup effects by the late great Dick Smith, and astonishing cinematography by Owen Roizman.

Highly Recommended.", "This isn't a horror classic for nothing. Sure, some of the effects are a little dated and it occasionally shows adaption-syndrome but magnificent performances from people like Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller really help sell the terror.", "Horrifying, disturbing, and chilling, The Exorcist is the perfect example of a classic, well made horror picture!", "The Exorcist, I think many agree, is probably the finest horror film ever made. The film has a level of verisimilitude which is nearly overpowering. I, myself, am an atheist, and do not believe in devils, but the fear which the movie exploits isn\\'t primarily religious. The fear that we not ourselves, that something utterly alien is speaking through us, something which uses us, and diminishes all our autonomy (imagined or otherwise) -- I think we can all relate to that horror. The Exorcist is a nearly perfect movie, and certainly a perfect experience of terror.   So many elements of this film distinguish it. There is a heightened sense of realism in all of the medical procedures; likewise with the Catholic rituals. The movie has superb suspense, as Regan is slowly transformed from a sweet, sensitive girl to a monstrosity. But, the christology in the film is also powerful: one may imagine that the Devil succeeds in this utter distortion of creation, but, since Christ has already been there (on Golgotha) the Devil doesn\\'t count on his self-less, unconditional love -- here, in the person of the Jesuit priest Karras, who absorbs the evil to save the child. Friedkin and his collaborators have made a truly eloquent story which is, ultimately, about salvation and redemption through love. The Devil\\'s intent (discussed by Karras &amp; Merrin on the steps to the girl\\'s room in the director\\'s cut) was to make us reject God\\'s love, and, likewise, to reject our possibility of loving, too. But love and redemption triumph, almost BECAUSE of the Devil\\'s spectacular manifestation of power. Karras, a priest worn down with the emptiness of himself and the world, renews his faith through his encounter with the Devil (there is that beautiful scene of the consecration -- and, really, Catholics might \"get it\" most of all -- when he accepts that \"mystery of faith\"). Many other things might be said about the film from a technical perspective, as well. But I have never understood anyone -- mostly rather conservative Christians -- who say the film is demonic. The movie is no more demonic than the bible -- and it really tells the same story: God is Love, and Love triumphs over evil.  Thinking about it, this is really one of the finest movies ever made, and I am not sure if it\\'s really horror at all...", "A very phenomenal and charismatic horror film, with Award-Winning gory make-up, scary scenes, an amazing script, and the best cast anyone could have chosen!", "A remarkable movie, scary even today.", "A cult classic that is a fun artifact from yesteryear\\'s menagerie of supernatural horror films.  Starting out in a desert archeological dig site in Northern Iraq, the initial set up for a film that predominately takes place in a Washington D.C suburb is as unexpected as it is ambiguous. An old man with an unspecified disease and who is, apparently, both a priest and an archaeologist uncovers some allegedly unusual artifacts within an Assyrian ruin. The first fifteen minutes of the film covers long shots of this old man, eventually revealed to be Father Merrin, looking concerned and distant without any real indication as to why. Eventually, this sequence is concluded when Merrin states he must \"take care of something\", thus ending the ambiguity and launching us into the actual plot of the film. We are then introduced to our predominate leads, Chris MacNeil and her daughter, Regan. Once introduced to the main plot, a bit of suspense begins to build with unexplainable bumps in the attic and an ominous Ouija board that the young daughter apparently has played with, saying she has spoken to a friend named \"Captain Howdy\". After a bit of back story regarding the mother of another priest, Father Karras, the real shit starts to go down. From shaking beds, spinning heads, and a bit of pee on the carpet Regan starts undergoing the symptoms of her possession - which doctors desperately attempt to explain through a variety of neuro- and psychological diagnoses. Eventually, it is decided by all involved - doctors and mother alike - that the best chance is to attempt an exorcism, whether it may work through psychological suggestion or actual spiritual power. Of course, this poses the issue of an atheist seeking an exorcism from the Catholic church - an already closed-off community and an equally closed-off ritual. While one may think that a daughter shouting profanities, wrestling grown adult men to the ground, spinning her head around completely, and having objects flying about on their own accord would be enough to convince anyone with their head on their shoulders that this is, indeed, unnatural phenomenon not explainable by mental illness, apparently it\\'s not that simple. And, for whatever reason, MacNeil chooses not to reveal this information at any point to the priest she is attempting to solicit help from - thus needlessly drawing out the process of seeking the exorcism. In the end, an exorcism is approved, though Father Karras is somehow unconvinced if it is definitively needed, and good old Father Merrin reappears after being gone since the beginning of the movie. Lucky for him, the demon residing in little Regan requested him specifically while literally speaking backwards. How sweet. Long story short, the exorcism is performed, Father Merrin dies for no reason that is particularly explained in the film and Father Karras, after loosing his marbles and shouting \"Take me\" several times, appears to be possessed instead and throws himself out the window and down a particularly long flight of conveniently placed stares right below to his untimely demise. The mother and daughter pack up, daughter not remembering the ordeal at all, and move away to live happily ever after, and so ends the movie.   While the plot is entertaining, there are certainly plenty of plot holes that are either vaguely hinted at or never really covered and exist because this is an adaptation of a novel, and apparently plot holes are inevitable when translating novels to film. Plot holes such as: why were the artifacts Father Merrin found in Iraq so concerning? What was that ominous looking statue he was so intently eye-ing in the beginning? Why did he return to America? Why was he sick and with what? How did he die? Why did Father Karras opt to do the exorcism if he was having a crisis of faith and clearly couldn\\'t handle the pressure? Why was there a random Ouija board in the house in the first place? Presuming that demon was the same one exorcised by Merrin in Africa, why did it choose little Regan for a host?  Delving a bit into the actual novel, the answer to some of these questions are revealed - the demon possessing Regan is called Pazuzu, an Assyrian devil, for example. But one should not have to Wikipedia the film or read the novel in order to fully surmise the plot without egregious holes. Regardless, the plot is mostly solid and provides an entertaining backdrop for the conflict at hand. One can easily overlook these holes in favor of focusing on the primary goal of the film - helping Regan MacNeil. Just don\\'t look too hard into it.  Outside of the plot, everything else stands up well to the test of time. The special effects were executed well given that this film is 40 years old, and Linda Blair, who played Regan MacNeil, was extremely convincing in her role. Between the believable effects and the stellar performance delivered by the cast, this film certainly outperforms many of its compatriots of the same era, and even some of a more modern time. If anything, it is the effects and the genuine performance by Linda Blair which is what lifted this film to its cult classic status. While not terrifying, as many like to claim it to be, it\\'s intriguing and fun to watch, with nice pacing and a fair share of suspense.  My overall verdict: come for the demon, stay for the performance. Just make sure you\\'re not eating any pea soup at the time.", "Definitely it's the best and scariest horror film I have ever seen.

I wasn't born until 1978 and I can't imagine seeing this movie for the first time back then. I heard rumors of people walking out of the theater they were so afraid and disgusted by this movie.

Even if you find yourself chuckling at some of the atrocities and profanity gushing forth from Linda Blair, later it will creep back into your mind. Friedkin employs a wide range of experimental editing. But the power here is that this horror film takes itself very seriously. Ellen Burstyn is especially effective, but all of the actors provide grounded and naturalistic work. The battle between good and evil will always lead artists to create valid work, but Friedkin presents it in an unbelievable situation and treats it as if he was filming the most important film in the world. The impact can't be underrated. Already firmly imprinted into our culture, it refuses to fade away. A true cinematic masterpiece.", "Another classic from the 70's that just didn't click with me.

The tension is expertly brewed to perfection leading up to the climax. This is not only one of the greatest horror movies, it is one the the greatest movies of all time.", "Easily the most overrated film of all time.", "The greatest horror movie of all time !!!!!!!!!", "During a time when horror films simply are horrible, it\\'s nice to watch a classic. Last year, one of the best modern horror films made was released. The Babadook was an incredible film, with wonderful performances and brilliantly scary horror. If there is one classic horror film that has inspired every horror film to come, i\\'s this one. \"The Exorcist\" is directed by William Friedkin and stars Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb, Kitty Winn, Jack MacGowran, Jason Miller, and Linda Blair.  The film begins with an archaeological dig lead by Lankester Merrin, a former Catholic priest. Amidst the rubble, Merrin discovers an amulet of an evil demon. Meanwhile, Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) and her young daughter are living on location. Chris is a famous actress, and she is working on a film in Washington D.C. One night she hears a scuffling sound in the attic. Investigating, she finds nothing. The sounds continue, until one night, the violent screams of her daughter indicate something is wrong. Rushing into her room, Chris beholds her daughter\\'s bed rocking back and forth violently. Her daughter begins to develop what seems to be serious mental issues. Seeking medical help, Chris worries for her child. As her illness progresses, the child begins to swear and speak in different voices. A demon has taken over her body, and Chris has no other choice except to find an exorcist.  Ellen Burstyn is a phenomenal actress, and she gives a fantastic performance in this film. Linda Blair should win best child actress. Her performance as the demon child was possibly the best performance in the entire film. What works so well about this movie, is the mother daughter relationship. If a horror film does not have a strong central story, then the film falls apart. Chris is desperate to help her child, and you really feel for her. When the conflict is resolved, you heave a sigh of relief.  Obviously, this film is scary. This is first rate horror, and it\\'s incredibly horrifying. Rising tension is felt throughout. It\\'s a steady rising that rears it\\'s head briefly, but saves it for later. The actual exorcism is probably the most spine chilling sequence of the film. The director uses brilliant creepy imagery and wonderful special effects during the exorcism. The cinematography by Owen Roizman is absolutely stunning, and the script is very well written.  \"The Exorcist\" is quite possibly he greatest horror film of all time. It\\'s a horrifying experience that\\'s masterfully directed. The performances are top notch, the score is creepy, and the makeup and special effects are superbly done.", "It\\'s widely considered, the scariest movie ever made. It\\'s not really up for debate either, much to my chagrin. I don\\'t think it\\'s as scary, as it is disturbing, and absolutely brilliant. By that, I mean, a film that puts the \"fear\" of God back into the viewers. What other film could do that? The Exorcist is a triumph of special effects. The demon, Pazuzu, looks just as good in 1973 as it does now. It\\'s a mystery why such brilliant practical effects were replaced with CGI. This film also takes you on a psychological ordeal. The line is blurred between reality and fiction, between faith and science, between lies and truths. You\\'ll keep wondering if it\\'s all just some kind of disease Regan has.. well, until the exorcism begins.. then it\\'s pretty obvious. I loved this movie. It\\'s a testament to the power of the cinema, and what it can do for people, for better or worse. People ran out of the movie theaters when the film was released, possibly traumatized. For the era of Vietnam, that is really something.", "Incredible. 8.2/10. B+.   Creepy makeup effects, fantastic &amp; inventive direction, and powerful performances make The Exorcist a memorable and effective horror film.", "Boring...not even scary.", "88% on my Tomatometer.", "This is a horror movie that has been built up all of my life as a horrifying movie. From the \"Dinosaurs\" episode loosely based on it, to that creepy Regan face that went viral on the internet (that never actually showed up in the movie... huh.) So when I saw that it was on netflix, I was excited and instantly made plans to watch it. So it happened today. The thing that really stuck out to me was the superb acting, especially by our little star, Regan. That doctor scene really made me cringe, with the injection into the neck and whatnot. Admittedly due to its highly religious tone, it might have affected me more if I was religious. Such isn\\'t the case, so one would hope that everything else about the movie would be enough to scare an atheist, and it did! The scenes with Regan were purely unnerving, enough to keep me shaking after the movie was over. I would give it a perfect score if it REALLY scared the sh*t outta me. Unfortunately, no hiding behind blankets or cowering in fear or life-scarring occured. However, for those more susceptible to a good scare, it\\'s sure to give a fright.", "Literally the best horror movie I have ever seen", "Really is timeless. A little slow, but so dark and interesting.", "Masterpiece. No need to say anything else.", "this is a great creepy movie! its very creepy and creative cause its the first of its kind, unlike now there are so many movies like this!! But I don\\'t get why it \"The scariest movie of all time\" its not scary its just creepy, but still check it out.", "This is an exceptionally made movie. I got to see it theaters too, which only made it better. The film might be a tad slow in the beginning, but it picks up quickly once Reagan gets possessed and starts doing weird things. During the scenes where Reagan is flipping out, the special effects are incredible, especially for the time. They\\'ll have things flying across the room, the entire bed shaking furiously, and of course, the projectile vomit. All of those look extremely realistic and they add to the super creepy atmosphere this film has. The voice they gave the possessed Reagan is perfect. If I had to choose a voice for the devil, it would have been that one. It really gets to you and makes every scene that has it way more frightening. The movie does have issues though. In the very beginning, they have this backstory about this little sculpture of the devil being found and I found it to be both unnecessary and kind of confusing. It isn\\'t really clear if the devil got released because of that statue or what. I couldn\\'t find a correlation between that statue and Regan either. Only other problem I have is the devil being very picky about how he uses his power. I don\\'t understand why he just didn\\'t break the straps and leave. I know they tried to explain it, but it doesn\\'t really make any sense. Damien Karrass asked him that and he responded with \"that would be a display of too much power\" or something like that. He says that, yet he\\'ll throw stuff all over the place and throw up on people, and even kill people. How is breaking some straps too much power? I call bs on that explanation. Other than those 2 problems, fantastic horror movie.", "Elegante, inteligente, horror\u00edfica e incre\u00edblemente innovadora para la \u00e9poca.

I liked the idea of the story and it actually did creep me out.   But there is a big but. For me, like may older movies, it tells to many stories at once. This led to the result that I didn\\'t really connect to the characters, which is to bad. It makes the movie way longer than it has to be. Like the story about the mom being an actress, the hole beginning sequence and dad divorce, mom in love thing.  I think they should have spend the time more wisely like for the ending, or making more scene. I mean if my kid runs down the stairs upside down and spits blood I would freak out and not just say \"oh god she is sick\".... I mean it\\'s not like we do that very day.  After such big build up we really don\\'t get much to understand about this demon or devil. On top of that the resolution feels to quick.

Well it was a good experience, but I would not watch it again. It\\'s just to long for that.", "Excuse me, how is it supposed to be scary?", "I was surprised at how badly the plot was told at the start of the film. Each scene kept flash forwarding at random intervals, producing a rather disjointed effect. However, once the film enters it\\'s second half, that\\'s when it begins to shine. Yeah, some of the iconic scenes have a lost a bit of theirs impact thanks to countless parodies and 70s style effects, but when she becomes fully possessed (right after the infamous \"crucifix masturbation/impalement\" scene) the films really starts to unnerve you.

Puzzled, her mother takes her to all of the best doctors to see what exactly is wrong with her troubled daughter. Only to find out that she is possessed by the Devil himself. The special and practical effects topped with state of the art make-up and voice dubbing make this one of the scariest movies of all time and also up there with the best movie of all time.

But these questions depend on certain things. If you have your mindset that this movie was made in 1973 than yes it does stand the test of time. However the films effects for its time are cool and still look cool if not scary. The next question actually believe it or not depends on the religion of the viewer. I'm catholic myself and that makes this movie more scary because the things that happens do get under my skin and shock me but that is because it disrupts my beliefs. Finally the movie (thankfully) is not cheesy and is still good.", "Even after years of countless horror films being made, none have yet to touch the pinnacle of sheer terror that the Exorcist brought to the screen.

I think I would have been a happier person if I never sat through The Exorcist again. As anyone who has read my opinions on movies before would know, I'm not a fan of horror films (I generally despise them.) But this is worse than just a horror film, it is a film that plods along at such a slovenly pace that even I find myself anxious for them to just get to the head-spinning and pea soup. They throw in all these seemingly ominous things, like Max von Sydow finding some small idol or dogs fighting, and expect this to just set a tone for the movie. They are so irrelevant to the story that I just can't tolerate it. I'm sure they symbolize something that others would debate loosely relates to the actual story, but I rarely have the patience for that kind of artistic detour.  I find nothing enjoyable to watch in The Exorcist. It's just an assortment of disturbing images that string together and make it clear that this girl is being forced to do obscene or disgusting things by a grumpy demon who appears to have no goal/motive whatsoever. Sure, it is filmed with great use of lighting and colors and some of the makeup effects are superb, but all these elements come together to form more than 2 hours of film that I don't have any desire to watch. When someone talks about loving The Exorcist that's equivalent in my mind to someone saying that they love shoving toothpicks under their fingernails. I'm pretty sure I will go the rest of my life without ever watching this movie again, and will quickly change the channel if I see it on TV.", "Blatty's script, Friedkin's direction and some committed performances from its cast make The Exorcist a classic horror film that transcends genre", "A no-need introduction from classic horror.

With its admittedly over-the-top foul mouth, and an endless list of teen-appeal copycats, William Friedkin's masterpiece has had a progressively diluted effect over the years. But for each person who views it as over-the-top and vulgar, there are appreciators *cough* who love the way it does its thing, and never forget the head-spinning horror of their first time. It's a masterful flim, this. Friedkin weasels his way into your comfort zone, progressively builds up the suspense and by the end stuns you into terror. No gloss, no gimmicks, no self-conscious style. The Exorcist is one of the most iconic horror films of all time and it affirms the root of all of our fears; that there is an imminence and randomness in death, and the implication is that there is no certainty to existence. And those final 30 minutes have NEVER been topped.", "Very close to being an unintentionally amusing, scareless bore. All the more so as it takes itself SO seriously. Why this gets such acclaim is a mystery, but it does prove that when religion is involved, people sure tend to get over excited. Although it is well acted, you'll get more fear from opening a bag of peanuts. Tripe.", "Easily the greatest horror movie of all time, The Exorcist's themes and scenes have tried to be replicated by countless movies, but no horror movie has challenged the merit of William Friedkin's masterpiece.", "Non-rhetorical question: What would you expect from something labelled as, \"one of the scariest films of all time?\" The Exorcist is likely to be found in the top ten, if not number one position, of most of those lists. Yet, similar to how I felt about The Shining, \"scary\" seems to be the wrong word. Maybe I\\'m just a tough guy, but I did not want to hide behind my couch. These scares came in without my expectation, and they linger as I try to make sense out of what happened. My problem with most horror movies is the setup for scaring is so formulaic that I only jump simply because loud noises affect me that way. Director William Friedkin has such great technical and artistic craft for his scares. Devilish images flash or even hang out in some scenes, with zero explanation. I found them to be puzzling, yet mesmerizing. Of course, what most people remember from the film is Linda Blair, the sweet young Regan who soon becomes possessed by Pazuzu, king of the demons of the wind. If that sounds rather plain, I must stress the high quality of everything else. Regan, being a little girl, is harmless and innocent at the start, so much so that even when the devil has completely taken over her, spewing out verbal and literal obscenities, I long for the protection of her body. Minus the scenes when Blair is replaced with a puppet (ex. Spider-walking), she plays both sides of her character. To play polar opposite personalities so vibrantly is a testament to, given her age, her fantastic performance. It\\'s strong enough to forgive the admittedly dated special effects. The bed shaking, head spinning, and vomiting are regarded by contemporary viewers as some of the scariest moments, but I disagree. Shocking, sure, but not scary.  There are other characters to connect with. Regan\\'s mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, struggles to react rationally to what is happening with her daughter. She allows neurologists to perform electro-shock therapy on Regan. These scenes must be harder to watch in today\\'s world, given how dated that practice is. And when the shit hits the fan, that shit flies across the room at any time. In the middle of some conversation, loud banging or yelling can be heard from Regan\\'s bedroom, and then you witness, say, a possessed Regan stabbing her vagina with a cross and making her mother lick the blood. Disturbing and grotesque, yet done so artistically well. The two priests, one a young psychologist who is losing his faith (Jason Miller) and the other an old one who saw signs of the reign of Pazuzu (Max von Sydow), work together to exorcise Pazuzu from Regan\\'s body. (\"The power of Christ compels you\" has an origin.) The exorcism itself is so great in retrospect because [SPOILER] it is anticlimactic for the better. Pazuzu basically manipulates the priests into thinking that they had the upper hand, only to strike down one of the two for its pleasure. Outside of the statue imagery, we never see Pazuzu outside of another\\'s human flesh, a wise choice. All still feels supernatural, especially because of the fog that looms in various scenes. Cinematography is outstanding. Besides the devilish images that I have mentioned, the sharp contrast in some shots is quite eerie. Just look at the poster, as an example. And the music. My favourite album is Tubular Bells, the first few minutes of which are used as the theme to the movie, to a chilling effect. It\\'s a single piano riff that builds with an electric organ and electric bass, sounding both romantic and modern. The Penderecki pieces wreck my nerves too, similar to the soundtrack to The Shining. Nearly everything else adds to a chilling and tense atmosphere, which, in turn, allows us to be frightened at any given moment, not simply when the director or writer wants you to be frightened.", "Me being a Christian, knowing that demonic possession happens, I was very interested in seeing this movie.

The first time I saw it, I was well under the MPAA's recommended age, saddled up in a sofa chair that had been pushed up to about a foot away from the TV thanks to my father. Hours later . . . nightmares. Okay, I don't recall if I actually had any nightmares after watching this flick, but I'd be surprised if I didn't. The idea that some entity, let alone the devil, could take over your body and hurt those closest to you was absolute nightmare fuel. I've seen the film many times over the years, by myself and in a packed theater, and I can tell you one thing; The Exorcist is truly horrific.  As the story starts, we follow Father Merrin, played with great depth by Max von Sydow (who's sporting some fantastically done aged make-up). Merrin has seemingly excluded himself from the rest of the world, digging around for fossils and the like. This is in the aftermath of an exorcism he performed some ten years prior that lasted for months. We'll come back to him. The story races off to actress Chris MacNeil and her daughter Regan. Both Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair play a wonderful mother/daughter pair, and while Regan is disgustingly sweet sometimes, it's absolutely believable. Another story plays simultaneously to their relationship, and that is of a Father Karras . . . a man of God who's absolutely lost the faith, and tortures himself for the poor treatment of his mother. We bounce back and forth between these two stories as a dark entity possesses young Regan, and their two paths converge.  One thing this film pulls off so well, that most modern horror movies don't even attempt, is the character development. We care so much for these characters, and whether or not we're watching a scene when Regan's possessed or Father Karras is struggling with his family, we're invested either way.  Speaking of the possession . . . it's handled with a great delicacy and logic. No mention is made of exorcism and even when it is, it's passed off as an archaic ritual by both doctor and church. The writers were very smart to cover all of their bases here, so that when it comes time for the actual exorcism, we completely buy into it.  And that's where Merrin returns to the picture, and the finale culminates with both Karras and Merrin teaming up to drive whatever dark force is inside Regan out, before it destroys her. The conviction of which the lines are delivered here are superb. And that goes for everyone involved. When Regan is taken, you rarely take into account that Linda Blair is still playing her, voice aside.  Speaking of her voice, which was provided by Mercedes McCambridge . . . it is absolutely chilling. The tone and timbre are the stuff of nightmares. The make-up effects are phenomenal as well. At 40 years old, this picture has sound editing and make-up effects that rival most modern films. In regards to the test of time meter, this movie has flown of the fucking thing and into a category of its own.  I've spoken to many people over the years who have found The Exorcist to be terrifying and who haven't. Whether or not the movie scares you is irrelevant at this point, because it has such a great story to tell, with wonderful actors to tell it. It's not just a great film of the horror genre, but a great film period. The Exorcist is a cornerstone of cinema.", "This is the best Horror movie of all time!

Image is flawless, the audio is excellent.  Now as far as the movie itself and the effects, some of them are still amazing and they manage to impress, and the famed scene with the crucifix has as much power as it did when it was released...it truly is a shocking image.  If you for some reason haven't seen this movie - its worth to see it around Halloween at the very least, it is a classic and a movie that has yet to be remade simply because the original is so hard to top in terms of tone, acting and the use of practical effects still holds up for the great majority of the movie.

There\\'s some disturbing imagery, I\\'ll give \"The Exorcist\" that, but put that aside and the hype around this movie becomes laughable, as if it wasn\\'t already, right? Medicine and science fails and here comes the witchdoctor (the movie\\'s words, not mine) with his wooden cross and prayer book to solve what the \"88 doctors couldn\\'t.\" The problem with \"the Exorcist\" is that it is a \\'religious\\' film (and of course, that automatically means Christian whenever hollywood throws that term around) aimed at \\'religious\\' people (again, Christian) and so it\\'s difficult [for me, at least] to assess the accurateness of the claim. Excluding the religious aspect, the film is definitely an interesting viewing experience--and at times, slightly bizarre [I\\'ll explain later]--plus, \"the Exorcist\" is simply not a bad film. It\\'s just not the scarefest that it once was back when the majority of Americans were caught in the wave of the Jesus movement of the 70s.

The fossil-like, obsolete medical machinery that are used to try to determine if the possessed chick has a mental problem *shivers* I HOPE those contraptions are extinct. I\\'d give it a 3 or a 3.5 out of 5.  Note: when I said \\'slightly bizarre\\', I was really referring to the [harsh] techniques that were employed during filming. A lot of the scenes were literally shot in a refrigerator to capture the breath of the actors on camera, and I know that at one point--one of the actors broke either her (it was the mom or the daughter--might have even been both) neck or her back.

She sticks a crucifix into her vagina and spins her head around. She spiderwalks down the stairs and spits out slime. The movie has great voice effects. The demons voice is perfect- raspy and harsh. Fourteen year old Linda Blair did a perfect job of portraying the possessed Reagan. The movie is frequently copied and none of them even come close to matching the original. This is the scariest movie of all time and it may never be bested.", "The Exorcist still leaves me creeped out, even though it\\'s 40+ years old.

This film is light years away from William Friedkin\\'s best work, but it is easy to understand why it is his best known; it deals with very controversial themes, was a huge commercial success, and still inspires many horror films today. But I just can\\'t wrap my head around this mess. Modern moviegoers probably aren\\'t scared much by the film, and neither was I; it just too often feels like an unintentional horror comedy. The green vomit, the \"let Jesus fuck you\" scene and Pazuzu\\'s name-calling at Max von Sydow\\'s character are especially incredibly silly. These are undeniably memorable scenes, but not for reasons for Friedkin must have intended. The film also has numerous pointless elements, like why is Ellen Burstyn\\'s character an actress and what is the point of Lee J. Cobbs\\' character and his recurring request about going to the movies. The Exorcist isn\\'t the least bit scary or even atmospheric, unlike, say, 2001: A Space Odyssey five years earlier (and it wasn\\'t even a horror film), but the remarkable visual effects and makeup by Dick Smith and the terrific performances by Burstyn, von Sydow, Linda Blair and Jason Miller still make it interesting in places. It may be difficult for me to relate to the film as a 90\\'s kid, someone who doesn\\'t watch many horror films, and as an atheist, but honestly, this is the least scariest horror film I\\'ve seen in my life; I somewhat understand its status as a landmark, but not as a classic.

Unlike modern (post 2000) horror movies, The Exorcist starts slowly and builds upon itself.

The transformation is both brilliant and heartbreaking as this child did absolutely nothing to deserve this.    Her mother, played very convincingly by Ellen Burstyn, does what any good mother would do - EVERYTHING she possibly can to get her daughter well. But, when dealing with the forces of pure evil, winning the battle is an almost impossible task.    The flow of this movie is unequaled, and the acting is superb. The recently released Director's Cut, with the infamous Spider Walk scene, adds even more shock &amp; horror to the film.

But soon Chris' learns that her daughter is not who she is after she starts displaying strange behavior towards her like spitting out bad language, attacking other people and starts to show aggresive behavior. Chris soon learns that her daughter is possessed by an evil spirit and now Chris must call a priest to perform an exorcism on her daughter in order to save her life. I seriously love this movie and I admit that it is one of the best Horror films ever made and it is very true. Horror fans still pick it as one of their favorite Horror movies of all time. The reviews are extremely positive and the ratings in several movie websites for this movie are very high. I use to remember my mom told me that during her High School days she watched this film because she has to make a reaction paper for this movie and when she told me about the film I became extremely interested in it. When I watched it I so love it and I agree with every critic and every Horror fan this movie completely blew me away and I will never forget this movie I consider it as one of the most memorable Horror films I've watched since Insidious 1 &amp; 2, The Conjuring and Poltergeist. One of the magnificent things about this movie is that the reason why this movie is considered to be one of the most terrifying films ever made its because there are so many super scary, frightening and horrifying moments that everyone will never forget in this movie(Regan Macneil showing first signs of strange behavior, The Spider Walk sequence, The exorcism finale and the super scary levitation sequence along with Regan Macneil spinning her head)and these moments will give everyone nightmares where most people will end up leaving their lights on when going to sleep after seeing this film. The other highlights of this movie is that the film has loads of fantastic settings and of course the movie is extremely suspenceful and atmospheric plus the pacing is amazing because it starts out slow first but it never gets boring it is intriguing and intense rather than having any boring or dull moments thanks to the magnificent script of author and writer William Peter Blatty and the soundtrack is extremely haunting in this film and I so adore the theme song of this film. But the true main highlight of this film is the performances of the casts. All of the casts are magnificent and amazing with their performances in this film no wonder it was the first Horror film nominated for an academy award for best picture before Silence of The Lambs came even Linda Blair was nominated for best supporting actress as Regan Macneil and to be honest all of the casts are extremely talented in this film Linda Blair's performance is extremely terrifying and superb in this film and I love how her character changed from a sweet, lovely woman to a super scary possessed girl that starts doing crazy and scary moments throughout the film. The same can be said for actor Max Von Sydow who delivers one of the best performances in his movie career and this is one of my personal favorite performances he ever did on film since Minority Report and Linda Blair, Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller are one of the true main highlights of this film because their performances are so wonderful and they seriously delivered the best performance in a Horror film since Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in Carrie as Carrie White and Margaret White I so adore the performances in this film a lot. Director William Friedkin did a terrific job with his work on this movie and he managed to turn the script of William Peter Blatty into a terrifying yet magnificent thrill ride that every Horror fan will always remember and they will always consider this as one of the most memorable Horror films ever made and this is the movie that gave William Friedkin a name in the Horror genre and he shows proof that he is a talented director and I wish he can make another Horror film again since I haven't heard from him after he made a couple of good films along with this movie. Overall The Exorcist is a memorable, terrifying and super scary film that will impress Horror fans and critics at the same time and will remain as one of the best and the most memorable Horror films ever made William Friedkin you are a pure genius!

The Exorcist has aged well, and is still sending chills up audiences' spines today. The gruesome transformation of the little girl is not the highlight of the film. The demon chooses a psychological war against everyone close to the girl. It doesn't want to cause them physical damage as much as emotional damage. The central characters are Chris and Damien, as they are Pazuzu's (the demon) main victims. Chris is tormented as her daughter's soul is trapped inside a body controlled by a powerful perverse demon, and Damien deals with the guilt he pushes onto himself for the death of his mother. The demon uses these weaknesses to get into their minds. My favorite part of the film is the opening scene which takes place in Iraq. Father Merrin witnesses a series of omens that foreshadow Pazuzu's awakening, and realizes he must battle the demon once more.  Similar to other great horror films, The Exorcist uses effective visuals with little or no narrative exposition. This leaves the audience to infer what is happening. The Exorcist is a very powerful film that will leave you sleeping with the lights on.", "The overall eerie atmosphere, superb performances and realistic special effects lift this movie up from its occasional plodding pace.", "If you want a scare, then this is not the film to watch, but if you enjoy a psychological, horror themed thriller, then enjoy this bold tale keeping your mind active, during the venture.", "Perhaps the greatest mystery of this film is how it became known as \"the most frightening horror movie of all time\".

I think that Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells should be played more.", "It sucked lol why is this considered a classic? It was just weird if anything, it wasn't scary at all.", "The Exorcist (1973) - 7  First time I see this horror classic. Didn\\'t impress, technically competent, good acting overall but the directing could be more interesting, could be more polished. The horror potential I can see in this movie, the prospect of a mother witnessing the perverse transformation of her daughter with the high risk of loosening her, is all there is to it as far as I seriously care. Seems to me \"The Exorcist\" has more ability to break my heart than to be spooky just for the sake of it, more of an emotional drama for greater horror effect, a quality I do appreciate, but far from good enough to warrant its current reputation. This movie exemplifies very well the reason why I despise the Horror genre, it\\'s a challenge to make a frightening movie that is also a good cinematic experience, must stuff in this genre falls short of being a good cinematic experience for me, no matter how disturbing they are, I just can\\'t take them seriously because they\\'re crap. And the rare titles that happen to be good works of cinema are not frightening nor disturbing at all, it\\'s hard to come up with something with just the right balance nowadays. I can\\'t understand how this film acquired the scariest label, much less how it is deemed one of the best ever made. Maybe the spectrum of the demon or evil spirit does impress and frighten those who have religious beliefs or who actually believe that stuff, go figure. Cinematically and horrifically it doesn\\'t stand to the praise it has received in my opinion. I find it a vulgar and somewhat dated work, not a particularly frightening nor interesting experience, overrated. Technical competence and emotional power are the pluses in my book, as for the rest... meh.", "Hilarious. You really must see this, if only to see how horrible it is. It's strange to think that people were once scared of this movie. It looks like a mentally challenged middle school class made it.", "This film is grounded, realistic, atmospheric, and unforgettable. I have never seen anything that compares to this. It deals with the essence of evil in a very profound way. The cast is steller, with great performances all around. Jason Miller as father Karris was the highlight for me. He is a very sad character who sees nothing but pain and suffering all around him. He drinks, he smokes. He is very human and is struggling with his faith, not even sure if he believes in God anymore. I loved the bond that is established between him and his ailing mother. Later on, when he tragically loses her, he is made to feel horribly guilty about it and that takes away his faith even more. In spite of this, he is a very good man who is ultimately prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice in spite of his own quite and controlled suffering. The little girl is played by Linda Blair, who gives the most extraordinary child performance I have ever seen. She goes from a sweet and innocent little girl in the beginning and slowly transforms into a disgusting and perverted demon by the end . Ellen Burstyn plays the girls mother and her performance can only be described as harrowing. Her frustration, anger, horror, and sorrow as she watches her little girl descending into the pit of madness is enough to make any parent cringe. Max Von Sydow as the Exorcist, although he is in the film only briefly, is unforgettable. From the moment he appears he radiates kindness and love. He is facing the greatest challenge of his life in the finale scene, and he does it with great bravery and courage. All of the supporting cast are great as well, from the detective investigating the events to the secretary who works for Regeans mother. It is the power of the performances of this film that really bring the story to life.  These are all very good people with different levels of faith or no faith, who are human and doing everything they can to resolve this issue. It is harrowing to watch as Reagen is subjected to the equivalent of medical torture as an army of doctors try in vein to figure out what is wrong with her. Many people say that the spinal tap scenes are the most disturbing in the film and I totally agree!  Te film is stunning in its cinematography and shooting of the scenes. What I love the most is how a very intense and grueling moment of sheer terror is followed abruptly by a moment of complete science and stillness. Somehow, that makes it even more intense, because you are left some room to chew on it for a while, rather than being continuously bombarded by brutal imagery, which I think takes away a lot of the shock value by de-sensitizing the viewer. The effects in the film are simple but very effective at bringing the supernatural elements of the demon to life. Who can ever forget the famous head spinning scene, or the part where Reagens body lifts off the bed and hovers as the house is shaking with supernatural power and the priests are chanting \"the power of Christ compels you!\" (my favorite scene by the way) Psychologically this film is very disturbing in its portrayal of evil. This demon is sexually perverse, potty mouthed, and all together foul! It is basically ego  personified. Ultimately, it takes a man of faith, and a man who is questioning  his faith to drive this evil force out of her. It leaves you to make up your own mind as the what it all means. In conclusion, I consider this film to be a cinematic masterpiece. It is not a film for everyone, and is a very sad and horrifying film with very little joy. However the film is so well done and has such great performances that I cannot tear my eyes away. It is a must see for anybody who loves psychological, smart horror films!", "\"A DEMON TAKES CONTROL OF A 12-YEAR OLD GIRL\"   - One of the most famous supernatural horror movies is \\'The Exorcist\\' from 1973, directed by William Friedkin (The French Connection, Killer Joe) and adapted from the novel by William Peter Blatty.

It was also the first horror film to be nominated for best picture. \\'The Exorcist\\' brings the story of the demonic possession of a young girl and the two priests that perform an exorcism to get rid of the evil.

After a visit, Karras is convinced and asks the permission of the bishop to perform an exorcism. Because he Is unqualified to do it alone, Karras can assist the more experienced Father Lankester Merrin (von Sydow). Will good prevail over evil?", "An artists craft not only floats on mere Special effects but it stems from his ability to narrative stories, supernatural or real life, truth or fiction, that make you go \"ha ha!!\" from beginning till end.

Ok, I don\\'t like horror movie but ,since everyone said that this is \"The Scariest Movie of All Time\" Giving it a try won\\'t do any harm, right? It was not that scary, there was no jump-scares or whatsoever but then when it reaches halfway it gets really disturbing. You know, 360 degree head turns and the atmosphere, it was so disturbing that it scares me.   The storyline was awesome, a drama and horror, but I think there was more talking than the actual scary/disturbing part. The exorcism part and the possessed Regan was my most favorite scene. The exorcism part was perfect, the atmosphere and how intense it is!I love it! And the part where Regan was possessed was disturbing! Love it as well!  But some moments could leave you puzzled like, What is that necklace? What is it for? Who\\'s the demon? Why are they digging? Those weren\\'t explained, but I did some research and find some answer.  The character was fine, they were unique and the acting was great, the way they act make it looked like it was some kind of supernatural documentary film, it means that they act really well.   Now I see why they were calling it \"The Scariest Movie of All Time\". For me its definitely one of the scariest. The eerie atmosphere, the disturbing moment and the terrifying special effect plus that make up, was the reason why its scary, and I think I started to like Horror movies.", "This is a great film. As far as atmosphere goes, this film is incredible. The performances are terrific, the make-up and visual effects are really impressive (although somewhat dated) and the film's build-up is flawless. I think that the ending was rushed, but this might be something I look at in a different way after multiple viewings. I will happily watch this film a few more times in order to appreciate the artistry and effort put into it. Maybe I'll boost my rating up to a five. But for now, I'll just say that it was a really powerful horror film which definitely deserves to be ranked up there with the best. I can easily see it becoming at least one of my favourite horror films.", "not that briliant of a movie, the spider walk freaked me out.. but still the movie is not that horrific.. but it's worth a watch for it's a classic for horror lovers", "A horror film known to shock people so much that they vomited in the aisle of the theater and/or fainted. Only a movie with shock value and horror moviemaking genius can do that. Even for 1973, this movie is scary as hell!", "For me it did not live to the scariest horror movie.", "Very disappointing. Maybe I shouldn't have had high expectations for a movie made over 40 years ago but so many people have told me that this movie is still scary today. I actually laughed at how bad the movie was.", "The God Father of Horror Films", "Classic and scary shit!", "A great piece of cinema which will ever leave you shocked or humoured from the unusual content.   When I first saw it I felt underwhelmed from the hype I had heard however I don't see this as a terrifying horror film, I see it as a masterful &amp; interesting movie.   The power of Christ compels you to see this movie.", "Still the scariest movie of all time. Haunting, well written, fantastic acting. So good that Linda Blair was typecast after this.", "\"Psycho\" may be the most famous, most critically-acclaimed horror movie of all-time, but when you look at 1973\\'s \"The Exorcist,\" it\\'s often referred to as the scariest movie of all-time. At the time, it was certainly the most shocking in its subject matter, special effects, language, use of religion--everywhere you look, audiences were both stunned and entranced at this film. I feel like people look down on this film a little bit nowadays, but don\\'t underestimate the power of this film. It\\'s completely remarkable.  I know I\\'m not the only one to think this; this is one of few horror films to garner widespread attention from certain awards. It won Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards, and got a bunch more nominations in acting and filmmaking categories. Why is that? Why has this movie gotten so much more acclaim than other films in this category? It probably has something to do with the fact that the acting is so top-notch and the special effects serve to contribute to the plot rather than just be distracting.  But what about the plot itself? Well, it stars Ellen Burstyn as actress Chris MacNeil; her 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) has been behaving very strangely after finding a Ouija board in their basement. Her behavior consists of a distant gaze in her eyes, urinating in front of people after saying, \"You\\'re gonna die up there,\" and spewing obscene curses. It\\'s mostly unsettling because of how random it all seems; we don\\'t quite know what she\\'s going to do next, and we\\'ve seen that she\\'s a child of divorce, so even though there exists a certain dark reality within this character that exists from the beginning, she seems sweet and adjusted.  At some point, Regan goes to the doctor, and eventually to a psychiatrist; the doctors find nothing seemingly wrong with her, and she assaults the psychiatrist. And this is when the film starts to become not just a great horror film, but an extraordinary piece of cinema. It\\'s hard to even discuss the upcoming supernatural scenes; suffice it to say, they\\'re creepy when they need to be, and nearly terrifying when they need to be. A lot of it has to do with Linda Blair\\'s facial expressions and the makeup. Of course, as her \"attacks\" become more extreme, her voice is replaced by Mercedes McCambridge, who might have one of the most amazing voices in any movie, period. This could\\'ve been the point where \"The Exorcist\" just became a special effects show, but there are reasons why the effects don\\'t take over. One is Blair, of course. Then there\\'s Burstyn, who is strong and convincing in her role as Regan\\'s mother: appropriately caring, but also appropriately stressed and scared over what\\'s happening. Finally, there\\'s the authenticity of the effects themselves. They don\\'t look cheap, out of place or unnecessary. The more extreme the action gets, the darker and uglier the effects become; before long, you\\'re completely immersed in the horror.  Eventually doctors recommend an exorcism for Regan. In comes Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), a priest at Georgetown University who, while experiencing a crisis of faith, has to deal with putting his sick mother in a nursing home. He considers that Regan is merely suffering from psychosis after calling herself the Devil, but she references his mother, speaks in backwards English and reveals the words \"help me\" on Regan\\'s stomach in her handwriting. Karras brings in Father Lancaster Merrin (Max von Sydow), who we first saw at an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq finding a stone amulet resembling a bestial creature buried in the dirt.  At this point, the film enters the realm of legendary with an epic battle of good vs. evil between Karras and Merrin, and the thing inside Regan. I like how Karras has his faith to battle against, while Merrin has his physicality to battle because of his age. Everything about this whole sequence is memorable, from the dialogue to the effects to the lighting, etc. When we see how cold it looks in that bedroom with the puffs of breath coming out of their mouths, it\\'s real; they cranked the temperature down well below zero. They strive for the authenticity in this movie to achieve the purpose of making the idea of a possessed little girl entirely plausible. It\\'s an unbelievable climax to an unbelievable movie.  There\\'s something about \"The Exorcist\" that almost feels otherworldly, like whatever this movie has to offer is almost too much to handle. People in 1973 couldn\\'t handle it; there were movie-goers that fainted or went into hysterics while watching the movie.  Not only is \"The Exorcist\" scary in what\\'s happening, but also in the issues it deals with subconsciously. And like I said, the particular reason why this film works so well is its authenticity. Everything that happens feels believable, which, again, makes it feel like more than just a movie. It\\'s what I think of when I think of the term \"horror film.\" Innocence and purity warped by sinister forces into a pawn of Satan; that\\'s horror in and of itself. \"The Exorcist\" an extraordinary piece of cinema; simple as that.", "Greatest Horror Movie ever made.", "Was surprisingly scary! I felt that an older scary movie wouldn't be as scary as some of the more recent scary movies with better technology but it really managed to scare me more than some of those recent movies. At first, I was bored because it takes a while to get going but it certainly gets interesting quick! Overall, great classic horror movie.", "The Exorcist is a film that has aged very well. It will always be scary as hell.", "How any one found this scary I'll never know...", "Hands down scariest movie EVER.", "Horrifying. Chilling. Memorable. This 1973 film by William Friedkin showcases the performance of a lifetime from Linda Blair. This controversial movie based on a true story gave audiences a lot to think about in regards to their beliefs and what the power of faith can do.", "I started to love this piece when I watch it for the second time. The atmosphere created is overwhelming, especially with the great performance from the protagonists. The seemingly outdated speical effects are still spine-shivering from today's angle. The Exorcist is definitely a horror classic, but you can't deny it is also a perfect piece about self redemption.", "proof the 70s was better than any other decade: even the schlock was golden. ... and there's the unintended retrospective comedic value of a dr pimping that new wonderdrug is", "Probably the most famous horror film ever directed, this film has been a classic for over 40 years. It's an incredible journey into horror, madness, beliefs and demonic figures.... an absolute must see.", "Very good for its time. But the exorcist can't hold character development into its successions, rather throws it at us as green vomit and floating over the bed", "This is an absolutely terrifying and evil, Satanic movie that is most likely the most horrific, and at the same time, terrible movie ever released, which not only makes you want to sleep with your Ma and Pa even after age 18, but makes you want to puke up green everywhere just because it's a scary, but boring movie. It's evil, creepy, hideous, and you'd have to be a psycho to produce something as shocking as this! It's the worst horror movie ever made, and one of the worst movies of the 70s, even though it perfectly terrifies you. Not recommended.", "Before the impact that was \"Jaws\". Before the sensation that was \"Star Wars\". Before \"Rocky\", \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", \"Saturday Night Fever\",or even \"Grease\",there was the first major blockbuster phenomenon that not only shattered box-office records,but made motion picture history as one of the first horror movie in the genre that had a powerful influence that define a decade and established itself as the film that became one of the biggest hits of the 1970\\'s.  That motion picture was \"The Exorcist\". Never before has a horror film been the subject of so much prerelease hype,but without speculation as to why people went to see this movie again and again in droves upon it\\'s general release. As to why people who saw this movie had psychological nightmares upon its viewing to watch something reputed to having it audiences having fits of vomiting,fainting,even temporary psychosis. The culture impact of \"The Exorcist\" challenged existing regulations specifying what was acceptable to show on the big screen that was unheard of in 1973. The film stole newspaper headlines away from the ongoing scandal that was \\'Watergate\\',not to mention the esculating choas of the \\'Vietnam War\\'. Inspired by newspaper reports that was based on a 1949 incident of a thirteen year-old Maryland boy that was taken over by demonic forces,novelist William Peter Blatty made the possessee a girl. The book on which it is based had heavy doses of philosophical-theological speculation on the nature of evil which became one of the New York Times\\' top ten best seller list in 1971. After its phenomenol success as a best selling novel,the studio Warner Brothers purchased the film rights,and after numerous rewrites of the original script,Blatty finally came up with a version of \"The Exorcist\" that managed to meet director William Friedkin\\'s exacting demands. \"The Exorcist\" was William Friedkin\\'s first-ever horror movie,and this was two years after he scored critical acclaim with his crime thriller \"The French Connection\" which became one of the biggest hits of 1971 and garnered five Oscars including the Best Picture of that year. \"The Exorcist\" deals with the crisis situation involving Regan MacNeil(Linda Blair),the almost-pubescent daughter of divorcee and well-known movie star Chris MacNeil(Ellen Burstyn). When the child prophesis the death of her mother\\'s acquaintance and urinates in front of a roomful of dinner guests,Chris starts to wonder what has gotten into her daughter. More odd and shocking behavior continues when Regan lands in the hospital and is subject to medical procedures proves nothing,and from there the terror begins when Chris seek the help of a priest Karras(Jason Miller) in a bold and daring effort to save her daughter from the demonic forces that has taken over her. An intense battle between Karras and Regan\\'s demonic possessor along with the experienced exorcist Father Merrin(Max Von Sydow),dies in the struggle. At the end Karras finally saves Ragan\\'s life by accepting the demon into his own body,only to be throw himself,or let himself be thrown,out of a window to his death.   \"The Exorcist\" was a phenomenon in an era that was at the height of student protest,experimental drug use,and general questioning of authority. The film allows viewers to take pleasure in the terrible and sometimes shocking scenes of punishments inflicted on the rebellious Regan. But by making the demon so fascinating to watch,the film is full of nasty surprises that include scenes that were not for the squeamish or fate of heart. \"The Exorcist\" was so successful it became the top grossing film of 1973. It also made motion picture history as the first horror movie in the genre to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. The film was nominated for an astounding 10 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director(William Friedkin), Best Actress (Ellen Burstyn), Best Supporting Actress (Linda Blair), Best Actor (Jason Miller), Best Supporting Actor (Max Von Sydow), and Best Cinematopgraphy (Owen Roizman). It was victorious in winning 4 Golden Globes including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress(Linda Blair), Best Director (William Friedkin), Best Adapted Screenplay (William Peter Blatty). It won 2 Oscars in 1973 for Best Adapated Screenplay(William Peter Blatty),and Best Sound(Chris Newman and Robert Knudson). \"The Exorcist\" stands as one of the top ten movies of 1973 in a year that was dominated by \"The Sting\", \"Papillon\", \"American Graffiti\", \"Serpico\", and \"The Paper Chase\".  The film set the standard for the horror genre of films to come and opened the doors for the next array of horror movies to dominated the 1970\\'s like \"The Omen\",and \"Halloween\". \"The Exorcist\" held the title of the first horror movie in the genre to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar,a title that would stand for the next 18 years until 1991 when \"Silence of the Lambs\" wins the Best Picture Oscar and the first horror movie to do so. The succes of \"The Exorcist\" spun three sequels and a dozen remakes,but none of them has held up since the original that started it all in 1973.", "One of the scariest horror movie of all time.

As always, recent movies that are still in theaters or came out this year will get full reviews.    Horror classics are usually ass. There, I said it. Halloween, Evil Dead, and Friday the 13th all started things, yes, but the things they started suck. The slasher genre is horrible, and demonic possessions have been done to the death (no pun intended). But fortunately, there is a movie called The Exorcist. Defying genre tropes with ease and grace, this classic exercise in shock/horror cinema may not be \"Scary to this day\" as its many fans think, but it\\'s still more drama than horror, making it a very effective blend of memorable dialogue, powerful acting, and practical special effects that makes it not just a horror classic, but a classic in general.    The Exorcist is the story of a small girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by the Devil himself in an attempt for demons to open a gateway to Earth. To combat this otherworldly presence in her house, the girl\\'s mother calls in two priests, played by Max von Sydow and Jason Miller. Miller\\'s character is actually quite relatable (for a priest), and he has a down-and-out good-guy Al Pacino kind of aura about him. His scenes are usually the best; everyone knows the famous quote that the possessed girl says to him (\"Your mother sucks cocks in hell\"), but you have to actually see the movie to get the context behind it. He\\'s a complex character, which is something that horror movies nowadays are noticeably light on.    Although the climax is somewhat rushed, and you don\\'t fully realize that the movie is practically over until it IS, the pacing is pretty good, with a long and powerful buildup that leads to one of the most memorable scenes in horror history. The script is great, the characters are well-developed, and the story (although ludicrous) is gut-wrenching and fantastic. Final Score for The Exorcist: 8/10 stars. It has some issues, but I really can\\'t complain too much about most of it. It\\'s a well-oiled machine that (and I cannot emphasize this enough) should never, ever, EVER be remade. The fact that this movie is considered \"great\" but is really just \"good\" should speak volumes about the state of the horror genre. It does its job, it does it well, and it moves on. And that fact that other horror movies are somehow incapable of doing this is pretty ridiculous.

It's scary in the world it builds and does not use jump scares. there are definitely cringe moments in an effective way. Pea Soup being thrown up in peoples places. The classic head spinning or spider walking. It all works.  The atmosphere and performances are what sell it. Everything feels claustrophobic and grey, like there is no end to the nightmare that is unfolding around the characters. The main cause of this is due to the performances given by Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller who both have their separate story lines that then collide with the central story of the exorcism, and the consequences of their story are what drives the ending of the movie, and what makes everything feel more powerful.  It just works on so many levels, and there is so much imagery here that has been copied and pasted over the years that it was nice to see the original work and the original imagination.

Personally, I don't think that this was the scariest movie of all time, but it probably was at the time of its release. One of the reasons that it was, was because of the people that were lucky enough to see it in theaters, they truly got to experience it. And it makes me sad, watching the movie 40 years after the movie came out because I didn't get to experience what some people did, and this goes for lots of movies, such as the Omen and the Shining.

Director William Friedkin does a great job at creating this creepy vibe throughout the whole film and at capturing some of the most disturbing sequences ever put on camera, making this a memorable directorial effort. For movies like this you would expect some dated effects but the effects in this movie are absolutely horrifying and still hold up today. The performances from the cast are all very good and there is not one performance that I thought was bad. Steve Boeddeker's classic musical score for this movie is just brilliant and fit the film perfectly. My only complaint about this movie is that I thought the story was very slow at some points, mainly the first 45 minutes and some scenes throughout the second half, and it was just hard to get into. Other than that the screenplay was very good with some well written scenes and some interesting characters. Even though I don't think The Exorcist is a classic or a masterpiece I still think that it is a well made horror film that should be viewed by all.", "We all know the exhausted formula of the demonic possession/exorcism horror genre. There\\'s a girl somewhere in her pre-teen or adolescent years who comes across a cursed object or a haunted house or some other crazy stuff, and she gets possessed, and the only sensical thing for parent A to do is to get help from a random spiritual person while parent B acts like a complete jerk because hey, they\\'re divorced, and it\\'s completely okay to demonize the parent who puts all the blame on another parent. Or, it\\'s about a non-believer who suddenly believes in Christ just because of a little exorcism. But despite this exhausted formula, The Exorcist manages to keep its shine. How? First let\\'s look at the victim and the circumstances. Sure, Regan is a girl in her late childhood or early teens, but she is a character we can relate to when we are introduced to her. And her descent into the possession is rather a shock. Also, while most current movies of the same genre introduce the possession via a cursed box or a cursed house, Regan gets possessed via Ouija Board which is how most real possession cases occur (if you believe in it). Now, Regan only has her mother while her father is away in Europe. Thank goodness they did not make it another one of those clich\u00e9 divorced parent relationships where one is a self-centered jerk and the other one is supposed to be the \"cool\" but lazy parent. We know nothing about Regan\\'s father other than he is in Europe and away all the time. Regan\\'s mother also acts very responsibly and loving towards her child, which is what makes the possession escalation even harder to watch because we see how much Mrs. MacNeil suffers throughout the process. Also, she reacts to the whole process like a sensible person would at first. She takes Regan to a doctor and keeps looking for a logical explanation until there is none left other than demonic possession. Even when she does find out it is demonic possession, she is skeptical towards it until the last straw. Now, let\\'s look at the priests. We mostly follow a priest named Father Karras who is rather young and is beginning to doubt his fate. Now, in most movies of the same genre, the young, doubtful priest is the one who has no character what-so-ever, and is only in for it for God knows what reason. The point is, usually that character does not believe and by the end of the fiasco he believes. Or he\\'s dragged into it and he just decides to volunteer despite what little experience he has. Not this priest though. Damien is just a priest doing his usual work at the church and struggling to take care of his elderly mother. He knows nothing about exorcism, but he helps out because the demon makes the situation into a personal dilemma. Also, it helps that one of his priest friends is a friend of the MacNeil family, so it is more personal in that sense. That is one priest. The other priest does not have that much of a personality compared to the Father Karras. Father Merrin is the first we are introduced to. But all we know about him is that he travels around the world doing Archeology and writes books, as well as a few exorcisms here and there. But that\\'s all. He\\'s just there to be the experienced hand next to Damien during the exorcism. Which brings me to another point. I do not feel that the opening was necessary. Sure, it is vaguely referenced sometime later in the movie, but if it were cut out of the final product then we would not miss anything. Either that, or they could have explained it more. Now, let\\'s get to the other stuff. First, the acting was good. Nothing was out of place or melodramatic or underacted. The effects were well used. Especially for a 70\\'s film. I\\'m still questioning how they got Regan\\'s eyes to look how they did while she was possessed. I was guessing colored contacts, but I don\\'t think they had colored contacts in the 70\\'s. I\\'d have to look that up. But seeing them use animatronics, lighting, and various other practical effects is a nice fresh breath from that annoying CGI that is overused. By the way, that demon face that just appear right the heck out of nowhere was creepy. Especially when the lights flickered on and off and you could see his face just in the corner in black and white. God! Much better than having a random computer generated corpse hanging behind the person only to disappear when the person turned around. One thing that I like about this movie is the use of casualties. There is a casualty when Regan is first possessed. A detective investigates only to realize by the end that some crazy shit went down. Father Merrin dies, possibly from whatever disease he had in the beginning while exorcising the demon. And Damien sacrifices his life to rid Regan of the demon. This movie really thinks outside of the box, which is why this movie still has its shine after so many rip-offs have been made of it. It doesn\\'t try to shove catholicism via exorcism in your face. The characters make sense, and so do their interactions with other characters. The real scares are found in the progression of the possession and also in the performance. Seriously. That demon\\'s voice makes it tough to distinguish it as a male or female. I would rate this movie 5 stars out of 5.", "First time viewing. Not that impressed. Kudos for liberal use of pea soup and profanity. \"Your mother sucks ***** in Hell\"? Best insult ever! Seriously. I mean, if I had known that one in Middle School...whoa, watch out. I would have ruled!", "Before Emily Rose and Nell Sweetzer, there was the poor Regan MacNeil. Scary at that time, but a bit outdated today (I'm only 15).", "Dark forces are near, and who better to \"duel with the devil living in your mind\" than Neal Morse-I mean, Jesus Christ himself? The \"duel with the devil\" bit was a reference to a Transatlantic song, so that\\'s how I got on Neal Morse, who, in all honesty, is such a big Christian that he might very well be able to rock the Devil away. Well, unfortunately, he\\'s one of your better \"modern\" musicians, and was therefore not working back in 1973, thus, I place my investment back into Max von Sydow, who I\\'d imagine must be pretty excited about finally getting a break from those blasted chess games with Death and moving on up to the big red guy himself. Oh, well, it figures that he would just end up facing off against some girl possessed by Satan, which isn\\'t to say that isn\\'t well-experienced enough for the challenge, because in \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\", he had to deal with some serious face boo-boos... and was Jesus... you know, if that\\'s a big deal when it comes to a duel with Satan. Nah, I guess the face boo-boos experience is a bigger asset in this battle, because just when you thought that a teenager\\'s complexion couldn\\'t get any worse, stuff like this has to happen... and just after Christmas no less. Jeez, I don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with horror film marketers that they have to release material this disturbing just in time for the holidays, but hey, if the filmmakers really were trying to hit the Oscar season right at its peak, I\\'d say that their questionable efforts paid off, because this thing got quite a bit of Oscar attention, and it also swept the Golden Globes, which is even better, at least nowadays. Oh, the Oscars have lost their credibility so much over the years, but at least they had it right when they called this classic thriller good, which isn\\'t to say that there aren\\'t some scars to this effort, as well as Linda Blair\\'s face.    To a certain degree, this film\\'s story was always to be held back, because even though there\\'s a good bit of dramatic meat, as well as other weighty elements, this story concept has a certain minimalism to it, particularly when it comes to characterization, or at least that\\'s the case with William Peter Blatty\\'s script. No matter how much this film meditates on its characters, there\\'s something undercooked about Blatty\\'s characterization, to where you end up with characters who are not simply a touch distancing, but underdeveloped, which isn\\'t to say that this film doesn\\'t find things to occupy time that it could have dedicated to exposition. As much as I complain about this film\\'s natural shortcomings, minimalism might not be all that big of a big deal in concept, it\\'s just that it seems that way when you look at the interpretation of the story concept, because at 122 minutes, or, in the case of the director\\'s cut, a pretty hefty 133 minutes, this film\\'s length carries on longer than it should, being achieved partly, if not largely by draggy, excess material and filler that drag plotting out, until it falls to a state of repetition, if not aimlessness. It\\'s a while before anything happens in this very meditative dramatic thriller, though there are only so many points in this film that have well-realized focus, and when things drag out, they tend to limp out, and that\\'s problematic enough on paper, without questionable atmospheric contributions by director William Friedkin. Needless to say, Friedkin\\'s very atmospheric approach to this film works wonders at times, but as you can imagine, it\\'s not long before material to play up effectively runs out, and when those moments come in, the film really slows down, leaving atmosphere to dry up as bland, maybe even - dare I say - dull, and decidedly reflective of the pacing problems that really undercut the final product. Really, there aren\\'t a whole lot of problems with this film, and I\\'m kind of pleasantly surprised to see that, but problems still stand, and they\\'re firm, dragging the narrative along as kind of unfocused, if not distancing, enough so for potential to ultimately go unrealized, at least wholly (Tee-hee, \"holy\"). Nonetheless, the film rewards, placing some challenges before you, even if you\\'re willing to run with the infamous intensity, but still keeping you engaged, even in concept.    I complain about certain natural shortcomings, and I can go on a while complaining about shortcomings in the interpretation of this story concept, whose bigger problems, funnily enough, include stuff going on a while, but what makes this film such a hit is not simply the visceral scares, but the strong story, backed by an intelligent mythology, as well as audaciously disturbing subject matter, brought to life by many an aspect, even technical and aesthetic ones. The infamous special effects have become a little dated throughout these past couple of decades, but they remain quite impressive, with an adequate convincingness and disturbing effectiveness to their creative designs that compliment chilling imagery, as surely as a soundtrack featuring minimalist classical compositions, Mike Oldfield\\'s \"Tubular Bells\" and a couple original touches by Jack Nitzsche compliments the film\\'s chilling tone through a brooding tastefulness and atmosphere. The film is technically and stylistically proficient in a way that\\'s not simply aesthetically commendable, but breathes some life into the telling of this tale, which wouldn\\'t be told as well as it is without strong characters, who in turn wouldn\\'t be sold as well as they are without strong performances. Like I said, there are some characterization issues, and they would make the characters who are pretty prominent in this very dramatic horror opus fairly distancing were it not for inspired onscreen portrayals, which are found across the board, but are particularly inspired within leading ladies Linda Blair - who is layered and chillingly convincing as an innocent girl, cursed by unparalleled evil - and Ellen Burstyn, who convinces as a loving, terrified mother who suffers fear for her loved ones and herself as evil rears it ugly head into a humble life. The film may have a lot of tension and whatnot as a horror film, but there\\'s also plenty of dramatic weight to this opus, and much of it goes brought to life by the performances, which still cannot carry tonal depth enough to make this meditative film truly rewarding, thus leaving William Friedkin\\'s offscreen performance in charge of really bringing things to life. My parents still tell me about this film\\'s initial theatrical run in the \\'70s, with my mother saying that she did not actually see the film until later, but claiming that a local theater went so far as to install \"crying rooms\" for moviegoers (I\\'m dubious, but you get the point), while my father remembers seeing folks weep, hide and vomit, and forcing his date to stay in the theater because he had to wait, like, an hour in line and pay for the tickets himself after driving all the way from Arab to Huntsville to see the blasted thing in the first place (Not Arab as in the Middle East; that part of Alabama isn\\'t quite that... culturally modern), so this effort isn\\'t quite as scary as it used to be, but it hasn\\'t dated so much that you can\\'t greatly appreciate what Friedkin pulls off as director, for although Friedkin\\'s meditativeness dulls things down when material really thins out, when tension picks up, backed by an audacious attention to haunting imagery, the meditativeness soaks up, not only dramatic resonance, but chills that range from unnerving to genuinely scary. As novelty, the film isn\\'t quite what it used to be, but it will never fully lose its effectiveness, and it will certainly never fully lose its compellingness, because in spite of its flaws, the film remains inspired enough to consistently engage as a classic horror-drama.    When the deed is done, what natural shortcomings there are go emphasized enough by underdevelopment, dragging and atmospheric cold spells for the film to meander along, until finally collapsing short of its potential, but not so short that strong elements to the worthy story concept, brought to life by anything from effective technical value and score work, to strong performances and tensely atmospheric storytelling, William Friedkin\\'s \"The Exorcist\" compels as a flawed, but gripping dramatic thriller.    3/5 - Good", "When I first saw this film way back when I was about 14 years old I thought that it was the scariest I had ever seen. Well, I've seen it several times since, and I'm not sure whether it's the scariest ever, but it still packs quiet a punch.

It has achieved its fame through manufactured controversy (often thanks to religious zealots) and the use of 'horror' just for the sake of it rather than for a purpose. For examples of horror that works consider The Cabinet of Dr, Caligari, the original Frankenstein and Dracula, Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby, all of which draw the viewer into caring about the characters, empathising with them, questioning the antagonist's motives, allowing us to enter the world of the film rather than stopping us at the screen by reminding us of the filmic process through special effects and inappropriate spectacular visuals. Even the low budget, simple Blair Witch Project provides horror through enabling us to imagine being in a similar situation. Even the comedic Scream provides some occasions of horror through scenarios we can briefly relate to. But The Exorcist? No, it provides none of this.

Exorcist is saved only because of terrific make up and visuals combined with a good performance from Linda Blair, the child artist. This film lacks characters who have ample character development and it lacks a proper plausible story. The first 30 minutes of this film is really boring and it fails to explain what the evil spirit in this film is or how it was able to enter the body of the victim. Also the style in which the exorcism is done is also too conventional, the same old Bible and holy water stuff. Ever sine watching Insidious, I feel dissatisfied with most of the horror films that I see because I look for horror films in which the conjuring is done in a relatively new( scientific) way. There is also one more problem that I felt with this film, like who the hell is actually the exorcist in this film? there are like 2 of them and the main one comes only when there is 40 minutes left for the film to end. The way in which the spirit is taken away from the body is also not that exciting because you sometimes may wonder whether the ghost will go away in that way, but the ending is rather stylish to say.

I hadn't realised just how crude the scenes and language were going to be, emphasised more by the fact they were coming from a twelve year old child, so I guess in a sense this would have helped propel the film to the forefront of media attention. It's particularly focused on religion and beliefs making it even more controversial, but at no point did it aim to scare the viewer like many typical horrors. This certainly amazed and shocked but, never grossed out the viewer in a gory sense, making it different from your regular films under this genre. Some of the sexual references were that graphic that it did feel you were back in spoof mode, but given this film is now an old classic, you have to remember that there would have been no comedies made about this back in the 70's, meaning people were more likely to be appalled than amused at the first sight of such activity with crucifixes! I'd say its up there with the likes of the Omen films in the sense that it still provides an excellent viewing even in today's society, but you can't help but feel that the content of it would no longer shock us now as it may have done in the olden days, which perhaps lessens its horror appeal somewhat.", "pretty goofy, but well made", "COME ON!!!!

But compared to the endless stream of gross-out horror we\\'re exposed to these days, this film comes across more like an exercise into slow subtleties and character developments at the expense of being terrifying. And yet this film still does retain that unerring ability to get underneath the audiences\\' skin. Even devout atheists, or haters of the horror genre, seem to find this film hard to sit through for its oppressive feeling of inescapable terror. Its scares have somewhat aged since its release, but what this film never seems to lose its sheer grasp of atmospherics, achieved simultaneously by Blatty\\'s award-winning screenplay of his own great novel, and Freidkin\\'s bleak, documentary-like direction. Not to mention that all the actors are brilliant, and their characters unusually deep for this kind of movie. While many remember this for its outrageous exploitations into satanic possession, I have always thought that is also tells a moving story about regaining the faith and courage needed to take on such a frightening evil. The story of the mother\\'s helpless turmoil in trying to find help for her daughter is more than equalized by Father Karris\\'s troubling yet ultimately touching story of redemption, after his mother passes away and causes him to sidestep from his holy path. And just for the record, while I don\\'t think this film is necessarily the scariest movie ever made, that doesn\\'t mean that it isn\\'t still scary as fuck.", "The story was slow, but the acting and directing were amazing. I still don't understand some things such as why was Reagan possessed? What was the significance of that necklace? It seemed more of a dramatic horror, due to how much story and character development was put into it, and the exorcism is barley even half of the story.", "A very low quality film, by modern standards; the mood is lacking and makes little or poor use of music, the presumed \"fear\" inspired by the movie lies only in the shock of vulgarity and a few shabby (and often grotesque) special effects, and the plot itself is plain and unsophisticated, requiring the movie to be drawn out on mostly irrelevant details.", "A monumentally scary and memorable horror film, it stands up to the test of time in every way possible.

The music is of course superb not only because Mike Oldfield\\'s \"Tubular Bells\" has the perfect eery tone, but because Friedkin also knows when not to use any music at all. I would say the greatest downfall of this film is not its length or story, but its lack of frightening moments. Most of the movie simply isn\\'t scary at all despite great acting, special effects, and make-up. I can\\'t help but wonder if the story\\'s long development sacrifices the scares, or if it had spent more time on scares it would have sacrificed the story.

Often feeling more like a documentary than a sensational horror film, \"The Exorcist\" lulls you into a false sense of security with its measured pacing, only to shock the piss out of you when the Devil tightens his grasp on young Regan (Linda Blair), the twelve-year old girl whose health and behavior deteriorate rapidly as the film wears on. Blair\\'s performance is one of the most shocking and controversial ones ever given by a child actor. Ellen Burstyn plays her mother, a frantic woman taking her from doctor to doctor to try and figure out what is going on. She eventually relinquishes her doubt and calls an exorcist. That\\'s when Jason Miller and Max von Sydow arrive as Catholic priests and William Friedkin starts refrigerating the sets so that you can see everyone\\'s breath in the chilled atmosphere. It\\'s a genius touch -- you start to feel cold yourself watching this film. Adding to the realism is the absence of a traditional musical score, inventive sound design, and frightening makeup effects by Dick Smith. Burstyn, Blair, and Miller were each nominated for Academy Awards. The film was also nominated for best picture, director, editing, cinematography, and art direction. It won the awards for best adapted screenplay (by William Peter Blatty) and sound.", "The grandaddy of all \"demon child\" horror films, better than The Omen, better than Rosemary\\'s Baby, better than Poltergeist, Linda Blair\\'s ability to portray such a demonic entity with such realism will scare the bajeesus out of anyone with a soul. Everything is perfect from script, to cinematography, to special effects, to acting, to music, and if you have the Blu ray you may notice some things that will scare you some more. William Friedkin\\'s brilliant directing and some special sound editing make this one of the scariest films of all time, or as many call it THE scariest film of all time, it certainly knocked my socks off. The soundtrack doesn\\'t quite play as big a part of making this film really scary as John Carpenter\\'s music does in Halloween but Tubular Bells will stick in your head forever and it doesn\\'t matter where you hear it you\\'ll always think of The Exorcist and just how terrified you were when you seen it. Just a word of advice, buy some sleeping pills when you\\'re done, just try sleeping normally after you\\'ve seen the face of the demon in the kitchen...makes my heart jump just thinking about it, a timeless classic.", "This movie disturbs me every time. The imagery and symbolism used is incredibly powerful.", "The effects were exceptional, especially how sound was used, but when Linda Blair/Mercedes McCambridge, it was kind of dull.", "scariest movie ever....", "The scariest movie of all time. Now, you can argue all you want that it's not the scariest movie ever made, or thats not scary at all. It doesn't really matter, because this is a great film either way! Unlike other horror movies it doesnt rush into the scary stuff right away, it takes its time which makes it even more creepy and suspenseful. Another thing that makes it different from other movies in this genre is a little term called, 'Character Development'. All the characters play a significant role in the film, especially the faith struggling priest Damien Karras. The director William Friedkin uses alot of shots of Karras 'rising' into frame in the film, which subtly foreshadows his fate later in the film. I also like how Friedkin decided to put little to no background music in the film, other than a few shots and ofcourse the haunting theme which i believe appears only once in the actual film. It really shows that you can make a terrifying movie without the use of scary music. Also, most horror films scare people by things popping into frame, and scaring people, which i think its a cheap way to get scares. The Exorcist on the other hand doesn't use that gimmick at all in the film, and yet its still today hailed as one of the greatest horror films ever made. The last thing i want to touch on is the message behind this film. Most people are offended by this film, and consider it 'evil'. Which i think is not the point at all in the movie, the point is that good triumphs over evil. I don't wanna spoil anything but you can clearly see by the end of the film, that good has won and evil has lost. It doesn't matter if you believe in the devil and god or not, hell William Friedkin was agnostic. Anyways, The Exorcist is a masterpiece and deserves to be respected as a horror film, and as a landmark film.", "The scariest, ballsiest horror film ever made. There's nothing like it.", "One of the best horror movies ever made! Very creepy!", "Highly regarded as the scariest movie in film history, The Exorcist lives up to this claim by fusing together the perfect mix of style, substance and special effects thus creating a film that has forever changed the horror genre.", "It conjures its paranormal subject matter out of incredible visual effects and a spooky atmosphere.", "Some parts were pretty cool and the movie doesn't seem as dated as you would expect, but I thought that the pacing was too slow and that the movie suffered a little because of it.", "Probably the scariest movie you will ever watch.", "When something is billed as being the scariest film of all time, it\\'s already setting itself up for a fall. Being scared is an entirely subjective experience: what will leave one person catatonic with terror would have almost no effect on another - worse still, they might even laugh at it. The Exorcist still has much to offer in the ideas it raises, or the performances through which they are raised, but after 40 years of iconic pop culture status, it\\'s nothing like as scary as once it was.  Much like its cult contemporary The Wicker Man, there are whole sections of The Exorcist which don\\'t feel like a horror movie at all. It spends a lot of its running time as a mystery film or character drama, and only truly becomes a horror film in its last couple of reels. Both films seek to create unease through a series of strange events, which arouse our suspicions while also leaving the possibility that we are just being paranoid. But for all its odd diversions into musical and comedy territory, Robin Hardy\\'s film is the more effectively unnerving.  The reason for this lies in the director\\'s sensibility. Throughout his career William Friedkin has been a filmmaker who has confounded expectations, in ways both good and bad. He has always made the films he wants, just the way he wants them, and to be a true Friedkin fan we have to totally buy into these unusual creative decisions. But where Hardy\\'s juxtapositions in The Wicker Man actually contribute to the unnerving atmosphere by throwing us off the scent, Friedkin\\'s choices feel more archly choreographed, like he is toying with us often at the expense of the film\\'s content.  This practice of counterpointing the serious and the frivolous can be seen at the beginning of The French Connection. We are introduced to Popeye Doyle, one of the roughest, toughest, hardest detectives in film history - and one of his first scenes involves him busting a drug dealer while wearing a Santa outfit. Likewise, in The Exorcist, Friedkin shoots one of the main conversations about the ethics of exorcism in front of some nubile young ladies playing tennis. In both cases the juxtaposition makes the film memorable, but it also offsets and compromises the intended mood; we might remember it, but there\\'s no guarantee that we\\'ll remember it fondly.  Because of its iconic status, it\\'s very hard to judge The Exorcist impartially. Most new viewers will be aware of some aspect of its legacy, whether it\\'s the infamous spider-walk (cut from the original version), Regan\\'s head spinning all the way round, the levitating bed, or the opening theme of Tubular Bells (which barely appears at all). There is a real danger of judging the film by its reputation, rather than actually seeing if it works plain and simple as a film. The only way to do this is to look at its different components in turn, assessing its technical strengths and the ideas it seeks to raise.  Whatever Friedkin chooses to fill his scenes with, The Exorcist is a good-looking film, at least for the time. Owen Roizman collaborated with Friedkin on The French Connection, and would later shoot The Stepford Wives, Network and Tootsie - in short, he knows what he\\'s doing. His use of shadows is very effective, particularly in the exterior scenes around the Georgetown steps and the corners of Chris and Regan\\'s house. Some shots are overly static, lending the film a creaky feel, but it never feels like the cinematographer is trying to impose himself or a given genre onto the story.  The film also has a very good cast, many of whom have become icons of the horror genre. Linda Blair is magnificent in her most famous role, drawing us in with the sweetness and innocence of Regan, and then freaking us out as this part of her is steadily drained and corrupted, before finally being rediscovered. Jason Miller is great as Father Karras, using his slumped shoulders and the lower part of his face to convey the burden on the troubled priest. Max von Sydow has a good amount of gravitas as Father Marin, and Ellen Burstyn rounds the cast out nicely as Chris McNeil, though she can be annoying at times.  The ideas raised in The Exorcist remain hugely controversial, particularly in this age of increased public scepticism and a heightened awareness of church scandal and corruption. Its main idea is that there can be discernible, physical proof of the existence of good and evil, and that faith is a powerful and important means of combatting the latter. While many film villains are built around and ultimately explained through trauma and psychology, Pazuzu is far more intangible, and the film offers few answers about his origins, motivations or eventual fate.  The four main characters are arranged on a spectrum according to the extent of their faith, and in what force they chose to believe. Chris has no faith, referring to priests as \"witch-doctors\" when the idea of an exorcism is first floated. She spends the film is a state of desperation, barely clinging on, and arguably the only reason she survives is because the demon did not target her initially.  Karras wears the cloth but is troubled by the death of his mother; the demon exploits his insecurity, and only when faced with the reality of his own death does he fully commit, and in doing so save Regan. Marin\\'s faith is rock-solid: previous experiences with exorcism, coupled with a life spent in the service of God, have completely removed his fear of death. In the middle of all this is Regan, the unfortunate innocent who is not yet capable of understanding the forces warring over her soul. We could spend an age discussing the role and purpose of her suffering in a theological context, but the debates are perhaps too nuanced and complex for such a brief review.  The film also uses Chris\\' scepticism as a means of exploring the position accorded to medicine in Western society. So much of the discourse around science concerns its place in a grand narrative, moving humanity out of superstition and into a place where we know all the answers. But Chris is ultimately just as shaky and insecure in the doctors\\' keeping as she is with the priests. The fear of the unknown still dogs her, and the emphasis we place on science and reason is not proof that evil doesn\\'t exist, nor an effective means to combat it when it manifests itself.  The central problem with The Exorcist is that it fails to manifest these fascinating ideas in a way which can genuinely terrify an audience. Giving evil physicality is an interesting idea, and it\\'s easy to appreciate the craft that went into Dick Smith\\'s make-up. But the film becomes reliant on these physical effects to such an extent that the atmosphere built up in its early sections is compromised. It\\'s not a shock-fest, but it isn\\'t as intimidating as it should be.  When he made Rosemary\\'s Baby five years previously, Roman Polanski very consciously played on the characters\\' surroundings to increase the tension. By emphasising the intimidating architecture of Rosemary\\'s flat and the apartment complex as a whole, he created a sense of the whole world being against her even before the devil worshippers were introduced.  The Exorcist has moments where it becomes visceral and very scary - one of the main ones being where Regan is under medical examination. But these moments are interspersed with long sections of rudderless calm, so that when the scares intrude, they seem like more of a gimmick than was ever intended. You will be scared at some point watching the film, but Friedkin never quite achieves the level of unrelenting terror that Polanski created. There\\'s something not quite right when a story driven by the Devil\\'s influence isn\\'t constantly intimidating.  The Exorcist is an intelligent and interesting horror movie which is more successful as a series of theological problems than as a means to be constantly scared. The cast and production values are very solid, and its ideas are well-formed without being neatly resolved - it just isn\\'t scary enough to match the standard laid down by Polanski or his predecessors. In the end, the film is a must-see but not a must-love, and is by no means Friedkin\\'s finest hour.", "When something is billed as being the scariest film of all time, it\\'s already setting itself up for a fall.

The legends surrounding the showings of this film are a good example of what the picture has become, from tales of priests walking the isles of the theatre before the commencement to bless those about to watch, to literal faintings an vomiting durring the viewings.  Many have gone so far as to call the film itself \"evil\", and actors involved in the filming have described it as \"cursed\" with varying degrees of seriousness.  Watching the film now, the shocks may be toned down... but artistically the triumph is undeniable. Acting, special effects and writing all add to a fully captivating film that never lets go of atmosphere. Some of the visuals are beyond upsetting, and even if they do not inspire \"fear\" in the sense of the word anymore, the inspire discomfort and disgust, and even downright blasphemy.  Detractors of the film have often missed that the film is a typical tale of good and evil, a battle of light and darkness. In fact, parts of the film even feel like they could have been sponsored by the Catholic Church. The contrast of evil and good, purity and filth, Satan and Angels, make this one of the greatest films of all time.", "Sweep all opinions of cheesy camera work underneath a rug because the eras are incomparable. This film would deserve a face on the Rushmore of Horror films if it existed.", "Classic horror flick. I love the story and the quotes. Just wish the special effects were better even though its from the 70s. If anything, The Exorcist is on my Top 5 favorite horror movie films. Its just that great.", "The Exorcist is one of those one in a kind films that has people have tried to duplicate, and have failed to succeed either because they went to far with it or because they just couldn't do it the way that it was originally done. When this film came out it was the scariest movie of all time. But what made it so good was that not only was it a really freaky movie, but it was also a really good quality movie. Unlike most films in this genre the acting is great, and there is more of a story that isn't just about the possession. The film is slow so it can develop the story and its background more, which most films over thirty-five years old tend to do.  The film is also extremely well done for a film from its time. For a film that is almost forty years old it has amazing special effects. I will admit that certain things look fake, like when her head spins it is really fake now, but almost everything looks real. What is good about it is that it is more reliant on things like lighting, then computer effects. Because of that they are able to make things seem more real.  The film is just as much of a drama as it is a horror film. It is slow like a lot of dramas, and more reliant on acting, which most horror films aren't. The acting from Linda Blair is amazing. Her character before she got possessed was just the sweetest little girl. She was actually to sweet, and that worked because it made you feel even worse as she got possessed because it was such a change from what you saw at the beginning of the film. Linda Blair's performance must have been extremely hard to pull off, and the fact that she did it when she was so young was amazing.   The stuff with her getting possessed was the main focus of the film, but there were other backstories. Like the story of Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) who would help other's that were losing their faith in God get it back again. He lost his faith after his mother died, and he wasn't there to see it. Part of the story is building up suspense for when he must regain his faith in the end and try to save Regan (Linda Blair). You know that he will in the end have to help save her, but a big part of the films suspense is building up to when it will happen.  While the audience knows that she is possessed the people in the film can't figure it out. At first they thing it is a behavior thing. Her mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn) is a single parent, and she is worried sick about her daughter. Nobody is helping her, because they don't know that she has been possessed for a while. I found that part dumb, because eventually it got to the point where it was really obvious that she had been possessed, and they still that it was a psychological thing. That part was a little overdeveloped, and they should have realized faster that she was possessed. Everything else in the story was perfect.  This is one of the greatest horror films of all time. It is one of the greatest because of how scary it was, how it inspired a new horror subgenre, and because it was also a great drama and suspense film. It scared the hell out of me the first time I saw it, and I loved it. I saw it twice, and it freaked me out just as much the second time, and that shows you how good it was. However some people in my generation tell me they thought it was funny. About three or four of my friends say they laughed at it, which I don't really get. I am talking to who ever is reading this. Let me know what you think of the fact that some people laughed at this. This is a great movie that should be taken completely serious.", "Somewhere between neurology, psychiatry and religion, this movie had a defining influence on the following generation of horror movies (e. g. Hallowen; Poltergeist). The research behind it is solid, as are the acting performances. Linda Blair is perfect.", "A film that nowadays may not be considered scary, but either way it's an iconic horror classic.", "Horribly scary and frightening. Very well written, too.", "classic horror. personally seen it too many times. almost never gets old though . . . almost . . .", "One of the best classics!!!!!!!!!", "This film is not just about Satan possessing a little girl with a oiji board: it is about a priest who finds his faith through an encounter with true evil. And it shows something of the power of the Catholic Liturgy. Although its better in Latin of course. The devil hates Latin.", "I just LOVE this movie since I was 6yrs old .", "Benchmark horror film!", "Very well done indeed. Exorcist is a beautifully creepy and gory film that's exciting to the very end. The atmosphere is what sets this film above all others in the genre, it's truly remarkable. The Exorcist is a near prefect film of truly creepy shit and horror.", "pretty good and watchable! demon gets into small girl and then all try to get it out.", "The greatest horror movie of all time in my opinion.", "Good movie, hard to watch", "What was supposed to be so scary about this?", "Great film making. Billy F really knows how to make a movie gritty and documentary like. A classic.", "A classic horror movie that scared the shit out of the whole world back in 73", "One of the most frightening films I've ever seen. All the make-up used in the film is fantastic for the year in it was filmed, all the atmosphere in the all movie are scary too. That battle between the good and evil is really amazing. However the others saga movies are so bored and without pointless. Same I think William Friedkin and all the cast made an excelent work in this film.", "It's an affront to the nerves, but a damn good one.", "The Exorcist is probably the scariest film I have ever seen... It is so hard to believe that a film which was made in 1973 could still have such a huge impact and scare people almost 40 years later!!! It deals with demonic possession and exorcism and shouldn't be watched by people who get offended easily because it truly has some shocking scenes... I advice this psychologically complex and effective film for anybody who appreciates the horror genre or cinema in general!!!", "Eh. The book is better.", "Now that is one freaky little girl!", "C'mon; when she spider-walks down the stairs? Still freaky. Even scarier since it supposedly actually happened near where I live. But regardless of location, the story is just plain scary. Kudos to the FX team; Dick Smith rules!", "I need to download it", "The Greatest Horror movie of ALL TIME!!!", "Scary, incredible acting, glorious music, mystifying story, and fantastic direction make The Exorcist The Scariest Movie of All Time!

Psychologically disturbing!", "Vulgar, brutal, intense, creepy, and chilling. Yet this original horror masterpiece is better than any other modern horror film.  A", "brilliantly made and disturbing powerful film", "An incredibly intense and compelling concept that will horrify anybody, not matter what generation they're from.", "Funciona como sempre funcionou. \u00c9 perfeito.", "One of the best acted and maybe my favourite films ever.", "I was shocked beyond my expectations by what this movie brought. It definitely deserves to be called a horror classic, while the title of 'the scariest movie of all time' is hard to defend. Excellent acting performances, very fitting atmosphere, and filled with tons of scares. A major achievement in the suspense/horror genre", "You can't call yourself a horror film fan if you don't like this one!", "The Exorcist is one of the greatest movies ever made", "It is Kind of freaky!!"]}
