# Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
The combination of python scripts given bellow scrapes all the reviews of a given movie from rotten tomato and analyzes it, giving it a rating from 1 - 10, where 10 means higest movie score and 1 being the minimum score.

Please install nltk and sklearn before running the script. Also, navigate to your python console of whichever virtual environment you are using, and type the following commands -   <br /> <br /> 
                                                  import nltk<br /> 
                                                  nltk.download('punkt')<br /> 
                                                  nltk.download('stopwords')<br /> 
                                                  nltk.download('movie_reviews')<br /> <br /> 
Also, make sure that whichever ide you are using, is having administrative privileges and it can access movie reviews folder (where I am using moviedir = r'C:\movie_reviews'). <br /> 

I have also attached an Ipython notebook so you can see the output.
